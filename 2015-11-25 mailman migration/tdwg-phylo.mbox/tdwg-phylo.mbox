I'd like to express my appreciation to Hilmar & Nico for organizing  
the event, and to the people who participated.

As an outcome of the LinkingTrees project, Dan Rosauer, Torsten  
Eriksson and I will be working to finish a preliminary  report on best  
practices for publishing trees electronically.  By next month we  
should be ready to solicit feedback from a broader group of people.   
If you are interested, please let us know.

The event home page for the 2010 working meeting at TDWG in Woods Hole  
has now been updated with documentation of outcomes:

http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/WorkingMeeting2010

Thank you to everyone who participated. This was a a short, single-day  
meeting, yet I think it was pretty productive, and led to some clear  
follow-ups and next steps. Thanks also to Arlin for presenting the  
meeting summary to the TDWG audience on Friday morning.

Outcomes from targets #3 (Kate) and #4 (Chris) are based on my notes  
from the wrap-up. Kate and Chris, please feel free to update and/or  
correct. Your wiki accounts should now be approved, let me know if you  
have trouble logging in.

Kate - it'd be great if you could add the source code URL for your  
XSLT code.
Arlin - if you don't mind, could you attach your summary slides to the  
page?

It's too bad we forgot to take a group photo at the event. Maybe it'd  
be better to have a gallery of individual pictures on the page rather  
than the sub-group of people we photographed later (and which is on  
the wiki right now)?

If anyone here who hasn't participated has questions or suggestions on  
what else should be on that event page, please let us know.

On behalf of the others,

Just as a reminder, we are having our working meeting today. I was  
just made aware that the printed program, and apparently also the  
online room assignment spreadsheet list us as well as other workshops  
starting at 8.30am. We'll give ourselves a little more slack, and kick  
fully into gear at 9am.

Thanks for your response Stan. I can't speak for other IGs and I can =20
imagine that for some (in fact know of at least one) the IG-specific =20
mailing list at TDWG may not serve a need that the group has. I think =20=

that's something that each IG needs to evaluate for themselves, and =20
hence my approach would have been to offer to each IG to do the =20
merging work for them if they chose to abandon their own list, rather =20=

than assuming that an issue for one group will also be one for =20
everyone else, and the way one group wants it dealt with will also be =20=

the one all other groups want.

There are, BTW, communities, such as OBO, that split almost =20
obsessively, and while that isn't exactly my preference either, it =20
does help with directing one's traffic where one wants it. Also, =20
systems like Google mail will automatically filter out duplicates from =20=

cross-posting. The bottom line from that is that it is better tools, =20
and working with the capabilities of those tools, that helps with =20
managing one's online communication, rather than having a single catch-=20=

all pot.

Hi Hilmar,

I'm not sure where Markus is, but Lee and Donald are asleep at the moment s=
o
I will step in and respond somewhat unilaterally.

I expect the wording in the original note should have been prefaced "If
there are are no objections..."  Your group clearly has an objection, so I
am confident that the phyloinformatics interest group mailing list will NOT
be merged.  Your understanding of TDWG's larger intentions -- to support th=
e
work of interest groups as best we can -- is correct.

A "discussion" of our mailing lists being over-partitioned and generally
very quiet went on over the last year (i.e., some time ago and not on the
phyloinformatics list).  It was a response to discussion on one list being
relevant to many and people finding it difficult to decide where to post an=
d
discussion evolving into topics relevant to many lists (Darwin Core, ABCD,
SDD, Geo-spatial, etc).  For those groups a merge worked well.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

-Stan

Markus and Lee -

I understand that there are lumpers and splitters in mailing list =20
design as much as in taxonomy. Similarly, there are benefits and =20
disadvantages to either.

We feel that we want to retain a mailing list that is the home for =20
communication of business of the =05Phylogenetic Standards Interest =20
Group, and where users know that traffic will be related only to that. =20=

That allows everyone to use their email filters to the best extent, =20
and to selectively subscribe to the traffic they want to subscribe to.

If you insist on merging or shutting down our mailing list against our =20=

declared will, we will move our business to a Google group.

I then also suggest that we have a public session at the TDWG =20
conference devoted to discussing this kind of unilateral decision =20
making over the heads of TDWG's interest group conveners. This is the =20=

first time ever as a IG convener hear about this. I was under the =20
impression that TDWG as an organization is committed to support and =20
empower their interest groups. What you are proposing here, and the =20
style of decision making and communication is the exact opposite of =20
that.

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-phylo,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-phylo into tdwg-content. The list tdwg-phylo will =
be closed and removed once the archives have been merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=

Just FYI, we submitted the abstract yesterday. The URL below should  
have the most up-to-date version. I've also linked to it from our wiki.

Hi all -

thanks for everyone's input and the enthusiasm - very much  
appreciated! We tried to synthesize this and our own thoughts into an  
abstract. The resulting draft is here:

https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ihH6MGKBCpH10sqvDK5ahLgvz6P_qP-TaN-vLt6O9j8

It is due for submission tomorrow, Sep 1, at  23:59 UTC which is (1  
minute before) 8pm US Eastern Time (if I understand the time zones the  
same way as TDWG does), so there's not a whole lot of time for  
changes. That said, please don't hesitate if you have any suggestions,  
and we aren't quite up to the 3,500 character limit yet, so adding on  
is still possible too.

	-Nico & Hilmar

To build momentum for a possible working session on linking trees, I  
put some parts of this thread on the twiki page here:

   http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/LinkingTrees2010

This is one place to indicate your interest by adding your name and  
describing what you can bring to the workshop (in terms of both real- 
world problems and possible solutions).

All of you should be able to access the twiki using credentials that  
you established as a TDWG member.

My main aim is to support data integration (rather than validation),  
and the two most important integrating variables for the foreseeable  
future (at least in my limited vision) are species name (or other  
taxonomic identifier) and geographic coordinates.  These are important  
partly because the great mass of users outside of TDWG are committed  
to using the same kinds of species names and the same kinds of  
coordinates.

Most phylogeny information artefacts (e.g., files) out there don't  
have either one of these , so integrating phylogenetic information  
into the global web of data isn't going to get very far until we make  
it easy for users to put this information into their trees.

To the extent that the scientific community is committed in the same  
way to specimen identifiers, then this makes the problem simpler  
because the specimen source would become the integrating variable, and  
would mediate the integration of data by species or location (because  
the specimen would have a species and a location).  But I don't think  
we are there yet.

The mapping can get complicated. At the level of taxa, one could do a =20=

one-to-one mapping of  TreeBASE taxa to NCBI taxa. At the level of =20
OTUs, the mapping may be one to many. An OTU may correspond to a =20
single specimen, a single sequence, or a set of sequences from =20
multiple individuals of the same taxon, or, indeed, a composite of =20
exemplar taxa representing a higher taxon. So, OTUs map onto sets of =20
observations.

Mapping OTUs to one or more specimen URIs would be great, if we had =20
these. But as a rule we don't. Most individual data providers don't =20
make individual specimens addressable. GBIF does, but we'd have to =20
assume that these were stable over time, and that we have tools in =20
place to map museum specimen codes to GBIF specimen URLs, and in =20
general we don't. This isn't a huge obstacle if GBIF were to provide =20
some guarantee that it's specimen URLs were stable, we'd then "just" =20
need some tools to convert "Museum addreviation specimen code xxx" to =20=

a URL.

Regarding #1, and assuming that this concerns molecular data where individu=
als often function as OTUs, I think it would be even more important for the=
 long-term usefulness of the data to support the ability to reference the s=
pecimen with a resolvable GUID or at least a collection code and catalog nu=
mber.  A simple assertion that =93this sequence came from [an unknown speci=
men identified to be] this taxon=94 can=92t be re-examined or validated exc=
ept by the sequence data.  If you know what specimen it came from, the iden=
tification can be updated (by  more methods).

On the other hand, a full name backed up by a URL or source/GUID would be a=
 big improvement on codes and abbreviations

Here are two ideas based on the use of phylogenies:

1.   For various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid speci=
es sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with the human-r=
eadable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this typically isn't done a=
nd it's not always easy.  The goal of this project is to enable ordinary ph=
ylogenetics & systematics users to use current standards (Newick, NHX, phyl=
oxml, ...) to associate species names (possibly other tax ids) with phyloge=
nies in their usual workflows.  The focus is on developing short-term tools=
 and strategies that might lead to better long-term solutions.  In some cas=
es, its just a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly, possi=
bly aided by better tools for data input.  For users whose workflows rely o=
n Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids and tax=
 ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of the other for=
mats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or as complex as a we=
b service that maintains your mapping and does the translation for you).

2.  There is a huge variety of tree viewers.  To some extent, users need th=
is variety due to their having different feature sets.  But users shouldn't=
 have to choose the viewer based on data format restrictions.  The goal of =
this project is to improve the usability of tree viewers.   Assess the inte=
roperability (standards compatibility) of tree viewing software, develop st=
rategies to improve it, and get started on any strategies that can be imple=
mented.  Its not possible to modify viewers whose source code is unavailabl=
e, but there may be ways to work around this with scripts and translation t=
ools.

Hi Arlin - I agree that this is an interesting project,. You're more  
than welcome to peruse the TDWG Phylo wiki to expand on this idea, and  
let me know if you encounter any trouble editing pages there.

Are you planning to be at the TDWG conference?

various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid species =
sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with the =
human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this typically =
isn't done and it's not always easy. &nbsp;The goal of this project is =
to enable ordinary phylogenetics &amp; systematics users to use current =
standards (Newick, NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species names =
(possibly other tax ids) with phylogenies in their usual workflows. =
&nbsp;The focus is on developing short-term tools and strategies that =
might lead to better long-term solutions. &nbsp;In some cases, its just =
a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly, possibly aided =
by better tools for data input. &nbsp;For users whose workflows rely on =
Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids and =
tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of the =
other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or as =
complex as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the =
translation for you). &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div></div><div><div =

Hi Arlin and others

 

I think that idea 1 below is a really valuable topic to address.  The
ability to link tree tips to other sources of data by taxon name or
identifier is a threshold  step for automating a whole range of analyses and
displays.  For example, the software I work on, Biodiverse
<http://www.purl.org/biodiverse/> , links phylogenies to species location
data for visualisation and analysis.  It would be great to have it running
automatically online, linking (for example) trees from treebase to
distributions from GBIF.  To do this (and many other things) however we need
a better solution to the taxon matching problem you describe.

 

cheers

Dan

I'm sending this reply to only the tdwg-phylo list (sending to everyone
seems like overkill). 

 

Here are two ideas based on the use of phylogenies: 

 

1.   For various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid
species sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with the
human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this typically isn't
done and it's not always easy.  The goal of this project is to enable
ordinary phylogenetics & systematics users to use current standards (Newick,
NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species names (possibly other tax ids) with
phylogenies in their usual workflows.  The focus is on developing short-term
tools and strategies that might lead to better long-term solutions.  In some
cases, its just a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly,
possibly aided by better tools for data input.  For users whose workflows
rely on Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids
and tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of the
other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or as complex
as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the translation for
you).   

 

2.  There is a huge variety of tree viewers.  To some extent, users need
this variety due to their having different feature sets.  But users
shouldn't have to choose the viewer based on data format restrictions.  The
goal of this project is to improve the usability of tree viewers.   Assess
the interoperability (standards compatibility) of tree viewing software,
develop strategies to improve it, and get started on any strategies that can
be implemented.  Its not possible to modify viewers whose source code is
unavailable, but there may be ways to work around this with scripts and
translation tools.

Hi all,

we have reserved one full day for a Phylogenetics Standards hands-on
activity at the upcoming TDWG conference. We asked for power strips and
wireless network and tables that we can sit around and work together. The
only thing that's missing right now is what exactly we should target. The
options are wide open right now, with the two only major constraints being
that (a) we have no funding this year to bring people in who wouldn't
otherwise be there, and (b) abstract submission deadline is next Wednesday.

Any feedback or ideas, wild or not, that you have would be welcome - send
those our way.

And BTW currently this workshops seems to be placed on the Wednesday of the
conference week, so those of you blitzing the local biosphere will
unfortunately have a conflict.

 

Cheers,

Nico & Hilmar

I'm sending this reply to only the tdwg-phylo list (sending to  
everyone seems like overkill).

Here are two ideas based on the use of phylogenies:

1.   For various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid  
species sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with  
the human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this  
typically isn't done and it's not always easy.  The goal of this  
project is to enable ordinary phylogenetics & systematics users to use  
current standards (Newick, NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species  
names (possibly other tax ids) with phylogenies in their usual  
workflows.  The focus is on developing short-term tools and strategies  
that might lead to better long-term solutions.  In some cases, its  
just a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly, possibly  
aided by better tools for data input.  For users whose workflows rely  
on Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids  
and tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of  
the other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or  
as complex as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the  
translation for you).

2.  There is a huge variety of tree viewers.  To some extent, users  
need this variety due to their having different feature sets.  But  
users shouldn't have to choose the viewer based on data format  
restrictions.  The goal of this project is to improve the usability of  
tree viewers.   Assess the interoperability (standards compatibility)  
of tree viewing software, develop strategies to improve it, and get  
started on any strategies that can be implemented.  Its not possible  
to modify viewers whose source code is unavailable, but there may be  
ways to work around this with scripts and translation tools.

Hi all,

we have reserved one full day for a Phylogenetics Standards hands-on  
activity at the upcoming TDWG conference. We asked for power strips  
and wireless network and tables that we can sit around and work  
together. The only thing that's missing right now is what exactly we  
should target. The options are wide open right now, with the two only  
major constraints being that (a) we have no funding this year to bring  
people in who wouldn't otherwise be there, and (b) abstract submission  
deadline is next Wednesday.

Any feedback or ideas, wild or not, that you have would be welcome -  
send those our way.

And BTW currently this workshops seems to be placed on the Wednesday  
of the conference week, so those of you blitzing the local biosphere  
will unfortunately have a conflict.

Cheers,
Nico & Hilmar

In anticipation of the inaugural conference on Informatics for  
Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), we solicit all  
attendees to propose and discuss Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. See  
below for details.

Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings (BoFs) are informal, ad-hoc, focused  
face-to-face discussion groups that form around a shared interest.  
BoFs have a leader (usually, but not necessarily, the proposer) who  
initiates or moderates the discussion, but typically not a preset  
agenda. The topics of BoFs can range widely, including general  
cultural or computational infrastructure issues, or narrower questions  
such as how to make the best use of a particular software tool or how  
to solve a particular computational challenge.

Anyone willing to lead such a group can propose a BoF. iEvoBio will  
provide space that can accommodate up to 8-10 BoFs. Sign-up sheets  
will be provided on-site on the first day of the conference where  
attendees can propose a BoF or sign up for one proposed by someone  
else. BoFs will be about 1 hr in duration and take place in the  
afternoon of the second day of the conference.

In line with their informal nature, there is no official prior call  
for or submission of BoFs. However, we encourage those intending to  
propose one to sound out or rally potential attendees ahead of time.  
We suggest to employ Twitter (http://twitter.com) for this, using the  
#ievobioBof tag to mark BoF proposals and comments.

Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed  
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks  
(closed), 2) Lightning talks (waiting list only), 3) Challenge  
entries, and 4) Software Bazaar entries. The Calls for Challenge  
entries (http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) and Software Bazaar  
entries (http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/) remain open.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

This is a reminder that the Call for Challenge entries for the  
inaugural conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio) closes in two weeks on June 21, 2010.

The theme of the 2010 iEvoBio conference challenge is "New  
visualization methods for evolutionary data". Visualizing evolution is  
a key part of our discipline and presents opportunities as much as it  
does obstacles. The iEvoBio Challenge is deliberately wide ranging:  
entries could range from geophylogenies to visualizing extremely large  
phylogenetic trees, to mashups showing relationships between lineages  
and other types of data (e.g. conservation status).

Further information on the nature of challenge entries and how to  
submit them can be found on the iEvoBio website at http://ievobio.org/challenge.html 
. Selected candidates will make short oral presentations to  
demonstrate their visualization in a "Challenge session" at the  
conference, and will automatically be entered into the Software Bazaar  
if suitable.

The winners of the Challenge will be judged collectively by the  
iEvoBio participants. There will be cash prizes for the first place  
($1,000) and runner up entries.

Challenge entries are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that  
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2)  
Lightning talks, 3) Software Bazaar entries, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather  
gatherings. The Calls for Lightning Talks and Software Bazaar entries  
remain open (see http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/), and  
information on the Birds-of-a-Feather session is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  Continuous updates can also be  
found on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

The Call for Software Bazaar entries is now open for the inaugural  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/ 
2010. See below for instructions.

The Software Bazaar features presenters demonstrating their software  
live on a laptop. At iEvoBio, this session takes the place of a poster  
session, and will be between 1.5-2 hours in duration. Conference  
attendees will be able to walk from one demonstration to the next and  
open a conversation with the presenters.  Please also see our FAQ for  
this information (http://ievobio.org/faq.html#software). The Software  
Bazaar is part of the interactive afternoon program on the first  
conference day.

Entries should be software aimed at advancing research in  
phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, and can include  
interactive visualizations that have been pre-computed (such as SVGs,  
or Google Earth-compatible KML files).

Submissions consist of a title, which will typically be the name of  
the software (or visualization method) being presented, the URL of a  
website where more information about the software can be obtained, and  
the license under which the source code is available. The provided  
website must contain a link to where the source code (and possibly  
binaries) can be downloaded. If it is not obvious from the provided  
website, the submission must describe what the software does.  
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the  
conference (see above), and need to be able to verify whether the open- 
source requirement(*) is met.

Presenters are expected to bring their own laptops for presentation,  
and any auxiliary devices necessary (such as a mouse). Power will be  
available at the presentation tables (110V/60Hz, US-style plugs;  
international presenters need to bring a suitable adaptor). Please let  
the organizing committee know as much in advance as possible if you  
expect to have unusually high demands for wireless network bandwidth.  
Note that commercial marketing activities are not permitted -  
presenters wishing to promote commercial or proprietary services or  
products should contact the Evolution conference about exhibitor space.

Review and acceptance of Software Bazaar submissions will be on a  
rolling basis. The deadline for submission is the morning of the first  
day of the conference (June 29). As the number of Software Bazaar  
presentation slots is finite, we cannot guarantee the availability of  
slots up until the day of the conference. We cannot accept submissions  
until the open-source requirements are met.

We ask all submitters of Software Bazaar presentations to be willing  
to also serve as reviewers of such, as described above.

Softwar Bazaar demonstrations are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed  
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks  
(closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3) Challenge entries, and 4) Birds-of-a- 
Feather gatherings. The Calls for Challenge entries (http://ievobio.org/challenge.html 
) and Lightning Talks (same submission URL as above) remain open, and  
information on the Birds-of-a-Feather session is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

(*) iEvoBio and its sponsors are dedicated to promoting the practice  
and philosophy of Open Source software development (see http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) 
  and reuse within the research community. For this reason, software  
to be demonstrated to conference attendees must be licensed with a  
recognized Open Source License (see http://www.opensource.org/ 
licenses/), and be available for download, including source code, by a  
tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used  
version control system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or  
Mercurial.  Authors are advised that non-compliant submissions must be  
revised to meet the requirement by June 27 at the latest, and in the  
event that presentation slots run out, precedence is established by  
the date they are first found in compliance, not the date of submission.

The Call for Lightning Talks is now open for the inaugural conference  
on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity  
(iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010. See below  
for instructions.

Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes. They are ideal  
for drawing the attention of the audience to new developments, tools,  
and resources, or to subsequent events where more in-depth information  
can be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more information (http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning 
). Lightning talks will be part of the more interactive afternoon  
program on both conference days.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at  
advancing research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity,  
including new tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data  
analysis, and visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long.  
The abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject.  
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the  
conference (see above). If applicable, the abstract must also state  
the license and give the URL where the source code is available so  
reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.

Review and acceptance of lightning talks will be on a rolling basis.  
The deadline for submission is the morning of the first day of the  
conference (June 29). Note that the number of lightning talk slots is  
finite, and given the high volume of submissions we experienced for  
full talks, the Lightning Talks track may fill up early. We cannot  
accept lightning talks until the open-source requirements are met, and  
so waiting with that until the deadline risks that the track is full  
by that time.

We ask all submitters of lightning talks to be willing to also serve  
as reviewers of such, as described above.

Lightning talks are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that  
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2)  
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of- 
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries remains open (see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) 
, and information on the Software Bazaar and Birds-of-a-Feather  
sessions is forthcoming.

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2010

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a mentoring  
organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http://code.google.com/soc/ 
).

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. All project ideas are  
flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match the skills of the  
student.  We also welcome novel project ideas that dovetail with  
student interests.

INQUIRIES: phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly encourage all  
interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early  
on as possible.

Hi all - sorry for the additional noise. The original email contained  
two errors: this is the 2010 program (not 2009, as the subject line  
said), and one URL was wrong. The corrected version is below for those  
who'd like to forward it on or print it out.

I'd also like to take the opportunity to highlight a few of our  
project ideas that pertain to biodiversity informatics and  
phylogenetic standards: #1, NeXML support in Bioruby; #6, building geo- 
phylogenies in Java; #10, a UI for MIAPA, the minimum reporting  
standard for phylogenetic analyses; and #15, Google Earth browser  
interface for TreeBASE.

The Call for Abstracts for full talks is now open for the inaugural  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/ 
2010. See below for instructions.

Accepted talks will be about 15-20 minutes in length and will be  
presented during the full talk sessions in the morning of each of the  
two conference days, following the day's keynote presentation.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at  
advancing research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity,  
including new tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data  
analysis, and visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long.  
The abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject.  As the  
number of program slots for full talks is limited, the abstract should  
give enough detail so reviewers can decide whether the submission  
merits a full talk or whether it should be moved to one of the  
lightning talk sessions.  If the subject of the talk is a specific  
software for use by the research community, the abstract must state  
the license and give the URL where the source code is available so  
reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.

The deadline for submission is April 8, 2010. We intend to notify  
authors of accepted talks before early registration for iEvoBio (and  
Evolution) ends. Further instructions for submission are at the  
following URL:
http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/information/presenters

Full talks are 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that iEvoBio will  
feature. The other 4 are: 1) Lightning talks (5 mins long), 2)  
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of- 
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries is already open  
(see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html), and information on how to  
contribute to the other 3 sessions is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

The iEvoBio 2010 Organizing Committee:
Rod Page (University of Glasgow)
Cecile Ane (University of Wisconsin at Madison)
Rob Guralnick (University of Colorado at Boulder)
Hilmar Lapp (NESCent)
Cynthia Parr (Encyclopedia of Life)
Michael Sanderson (University of Arizona)

(*) iEvoBio and its sponsors are dedicated to promoting the practice  
and philosophy of Open Source software development (see http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) 
  and reuse within the research community. For this reason, if a  
submitted talk concerns a specific software system for use by the  
research community, that software must be licensed with a recognized  
Open Source License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be  
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file  
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control  
system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.  Authors of  
full talks who cannot meet this requirement at the time of submission  
should state their intentions, and are advised that the requirement  
must be met by June 27 at the latest.

Registration is now open for the inaugural conference on Informatics  
for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://www.evolutionsociety.org/SSE2010/Register.html 
.

iEvoBio aims to bring together biologists working in evolution,  
systematics, and biodiversity, with software developers, and  
mathematicians, both to develop new tools, and to increase awareness  
of existing technologies (ranging from standards and reusable toolkits  
to mega-scale data analysis to rich visualization).

The 2-day meeting will take place June 29-30, 2010, in Portland, OR,  
jointly with the Evolution Meetings as a satellite conference.  The  
event will feature traditional elements, including a keynote  
presentation at the beginning of each day and contributed talks, as  
well as more dynamic and interactive elements, including a challenge,  
lightning talk-style sessions, a software bazaar, and Birds-of-a- 
Feather gatherings.

Attendees can register jointly for Evolution and iEvoBio at a  
discount, or only for the iEvoBio conference. For more information  
about registration, venue, travel, or accommodations visit the  
Evolution 2010 website at http://www.evolutionsociety.org/SSE2010/.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org. You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

NESCent Phyloinformatics VoCamp

OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Integrating diverse biological data with the historical process of =20
evolution
is a grand challenge for 21st century biology. The interoperability of =20=

data
from diverse fields (e.g., genetics, ecology, biodiversity, biomedicine)
requires a technology infrastructure based on formalized, shared
vocabularies.  Developing such vocabularies is a community project.  In
order to build controlled vocabularies and ontologies, the National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent: http://nescent.org) is =20
sponsoring a
"Phyloinformatics VoCamp".

We invite scientists from diverse sub-disciplines to apply for this =20
event,
as explained below. The application deadline is September 18, 2009. More
information about motivation, plans, and preliminary ideas is available
online at http://bit.ly/VoCamp_Proposal.  Feel free to disseminate this
notice to colleagues who may be interested.*

A VoCamp (http://vocamp.org) is an intense, hands-on, working meeting =20=

with
face-to-face interactions between a diverse group of people focused on
vocabulary and ontology design, development and application.  The
Phyloinformatics VoCamp will include ontology and vocabulary =20
developers from
relevant efforts, experts on knowledge representation and reasoning, and
users and developers of integrative applications that use these =20
ontologies.

This event will partially overlap with the Biodiversity Information
Standards (TDWG: http://tdwg.org) Annual Conference in Montpellier, =20
France,
November 9-13, 2009.  The VoCamp is an activity of the TDWG Interest =20
Group
on Phylogenetics Standards (http://wiki.tdwg.org/Phylogenetics) and is
partly supported by TDWG and the Universit=E9 Montpellier.

GOALS AND ACTIVITIES
--------------------
The objective of the event is to connect previously disparate ontology
development efforts, stakeholder communities, and interoperability
initiatives with shared objectives. Aside from sharing knowledge, =20
expertise,
and best practices, our goal is to build-out existing ontology =20
resources in
a hands-on manner in terms of ontological rigor, semantic richness, and
modularity that supports effective reuse.

We also plan to have programming expertise and activities present at the
event, such as for necessary large-scale transformations, and =20
especially for
proof-of-concept applications that directly apply the ontologies being
developed.

On a long-term basis, we anticipate that the event, if successful, =20
will give
rise to similarly structured follow-up events organized by the =20
participating
stakeholder communities, such as TDWG, SONet
(http://sonet.ecoinformatics.org), and OBO (http://www.obofoundry.org).


ORGANIZATION
------------
The VoCamp will be 4 days in duration during November 7-11, 2009 and is
co-located with the TDWG annual conference
(http://www.tdwg.org/conference2009) in Montpellier, France.  The =20
first two
days (Nov 7-8) will be dedicated entirely to VoCamp and the remainder =20=

of the
event (Nov 10-11) will overlap with TDWG 'workshops days'.  Participants
will have the opportunity, and are encouraged, to interact with TDWG
participants and attend conference sessions outside of the VoCamp.

The specific vocabulary development targets will be selected by the
participants partly in advance through a dedicated area on a wiki, a =20
mailing
list, and one or more conference calls, and partly on-site through an =20=

Open
Space activity. The exact agenda for the event will be developed =20
similarly,
but will be largely devoted to ontology and vocabulary development =20
time. At
the event itself, participants will self-organize into small subgroups
focused on particular targets. The VoCamp will conclude with a wrap-up
session, and a report presented to the TDWG conference audience.

We also anticipate that several "boot camps" will be needed to ensure a
productive event for all participants, for example on ontology design =20=

and
engineering, reasoning, and infrastructure for collaborative =20
development of
ontologies.

We welcome comments and suggestions for issues in ontology development =20=

that
are not explicitly addressed here or in our proposal but that could be
addressed at the event. Please email the organizers at =
vocamp1@nescent.org
with any suggestions.


HOW TO APPLY
------------
The application consists of your cv and your responses to 6 questions =20=

about
your experience, skills, objectives, support, and commitment to open
software development. To apply, please fill out the online form at
http://bit.ly/VoCamp_Form by September 18, and submit your CV  to the
organizers at vocamp1@nescent.org. NESCent will provide funds in =20
support of
expenses, including travel, accommodation, registration, and meals. =20
Pending
the final amount of funds available and the support requested by the
participants, sponsorship may need to be capped.
Logistical and travel details will be communicated to accepted and =20
confirmed
participants.

We specifically encourage applications from members of under- =20
represented
groups, specifically women and minorities, and from graduate students =20=

and
post-docs.  If you have questions or are unsure whether to apply, please
contact an organizer or write to vocamp1@nescent.org .

Please understand that funding and space for this event are limited.
We also need to balance a critical mass of expertise in specific areas =20=

with
broad participation. Therefore, not all qualified applicants can be
guaranteed acceptance.

Yours,

The Organizing Committee

Hi all,

as I'm sure you've noticed already, the 2009 TDWG Conference is coming  
up and only about 2 months away. Nico and I hope to see as many of you  
there as possible!

As the one remaining TODO needed to complete the formal establishment  
of our TDWG Interest Group, we need to get the group's charter  
written, finalized, and approved.

Nico and I have now written a draft charter here:

http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhdjhbvd_65ff7bp3dn

Since in order to be approved by the executive committee in time for  
the 2009 conference it needs to be submitted rather soon. So, we'd be  
much obliged if you can review the draft and give us feedback,  
comments, and suggestions by Friday, Sep 11, so we can incorporate it  
in time for submitting the final version on Monday, Sep 14.

FYI, there'll likely be significant activities of our group at the  
event, the announcements and Calls for Participation for which will be  
posted here over the coming week. Pending final approval for funding  
and logistics, one of these will be a VoCamp; check out http://evoinfo.nescent.org/VoCamp1_Proposal 
  if you're curious.

Cheers,

Hilmar & Nico

FYI, a group of collaborators (Arlin Stoltzfus, Karen Cranston,  
Sheldon McKay, Enrico Pontelli, Nico Cellinese, and myself) under the  
leadership of Arlin recently pulled together a grant application for  
the NSF Interop solicitation.

The ideas for the grant emerged mostly from the recent Database  
Interoperability Hackathon (for which I posted the announcement and  
Call for Participation here back in Jan). Proposal summary and full  
text are public at the following URL:

http://evoinfo.nescent.org/NSF_Interop_Proposal

It was submitted July 22. If funded, TDWG and this Interest Group will  
play a significant role in the proposed activities.

We probably won't hear about reviews or funding before Feb/March next  
year, so keep fingers crossed until then.

Cheers,

	-hilmar

Hi,

I was just wondering, is it possible to obtain, somewhere from the net, the
full phylogenetic tree for life on earth?

How big would the data be? How many nodes are there (counting a species, and
every split in the graph, as a node)?

I'm thinking of fitting it inside the interatctorium (www.interactorium.net)

Cheers

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2009 - STUDENT APPLICATION DEADLINE IS  
APRIL 3

http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a mentoring  
organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http://code.google.com/soc/ 
).

Students in the program will receive a stipend from Google (and a T- 
shirt solely available to successful participants), and may work from  
their home, or home institution, for the duration of the 3 month  
program. Each student will have at least one dedicated mentor to show  
them the ropes and help them complete their project.

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. Project ideas are  
listed on the website and range from hardware acceleration for  
phylogenetic inference, to support for phyloinformatics standards  
within the BioPerl and BioRuby toolkits, to alignment of next-gen  
sequencing data, to ontology term markup for biocuration, to semantic  
interoperability of web-services, to 3D-printing of phylogenies. All  
project ideas are flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match  
the skills of the student.  We also welcome novel project ideas that  
dovetail with student interests.

TO APPLY: Instructions are at the website (see "When you apply"). You  
can find GSoC program rules and eligibility requirements at http://socghop.appspot.com 
. ***The 12-day application period for students ends on Friday, April  
3rd, 2009, at 19:00 UTC (3pm EDT, 12pm PDT).***

INQUIRIES: phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly encourage all  
interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early  
as possible.

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a  
mentoring organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http:// 
code.google.com/soc/).

Students in the program will receive a stipend from Google (and  
possibly more importantly, a T-shirt solely available to successful  
participants), and may work from their home, or home institution, for  
the duration of the 3 month program. Each student will have at least  
one dedicated mentor to show them the ropes and help them complete  
their project.

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. Initial project ideas  
are listed on the website. These range from hardware accerelation for  
phylogenetic inference, to tree visualization within a wiki, to  
alignment of next-gen sequencing data, to development of a reusable  
ontology term markup module for biocuration. All project ideas are  
flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match the skills of the  
student.  We also welcome novel project ideas that dovetail with  
student interests.

TO APPLY: Apply online at the Google Summer of Code website (http:// 
socghop.appspot.com/), where you will also find GSoC  program
rules and eligibility requirements.  The 12-day application period  
for students opens on Monday March 23rd and runs through Friday,  
April 3rd, 2009.

INQUIRIES: phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly encourage all  
interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early  
on as possible.

Hi all:

NESCent is getting ready for participating in the 2009 Google Summer of
Code. The skeleton for the project ideas page, along with a template
for project ideas, is online:

http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009

A big part of the strength of our application as a participating
organization comes from our project ideas and a diverse roster of
primary and secondary mentors. If you have an idea for carving out a
summer programming project for a student, and/or can fancy yourself
mentoring a student, or are simply enthusiastic about helping out, for
example as a backup mentor, please let me know, and I will send you a
summary of how the Summer of Code program works in principle, as well
as guidelines for how to become a mentor for us or help out in other
ways.

For comparison purposes, previous years' ideas pages are here:
http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2008
http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2007

As for supporting standards within the program, last year for example  
one of the funded projects was on phyloXML support in BioPerl.

Cheers,

	-hilmar

(Note that the issue we are trying to address and the standards we try  
to bring to bear here are closely related to what we discussed at the  
workshop and the conference session in Perth. If you are interested in

     NESCent Hackathon on Evolutionary Database Interoperability

                     OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent; http:// 
nescent.org) is sponsoring an "Evolutionary Database Interoperability"  
hackathon aimed at enhancing the value (and raising the profile) of  
important community resources for evolutionary and biodiversity data  
by increasing their accessibility to users and software. We are  
broadly soliciting applications for participation from the community.  
More information about the event is available online at http://evoinfo.nescent.org/Database_Interop_Hackathon 
.

A hackathon is an event at which a group of programmers who otherwise  
do not have the opportunity to interact on a routine basis meet with  
users and domain experts to collaboratively develop working code that  
is of utility to the community as a whole. The Database  
Interoperability Hackathon will bring together developers from a  
number of emerging standards for evolutionary data exchange (NeXML; http://nexml.org 
), data and metadata semantics (CDAO; http://www.evolutionaryontology.org 
), and programmatic access of evolutionary data providers (PhyloWS; http://evoinfo.nescent.org/PhyloWS) 
  with database programmers and metadata experts from a variety of  
evolutionary and biodiversity community resources. In addition, the  
mix of people will include programmers of embeddable widgets, mash-up  
and aggregation applications that can showcase the value of the effort  
for research applications.

We also welcome comments and suggestions for issues in database  
interoperability that could be addressed at the event but are not yet  
on our radar. Please email the organizers at hackathon3@nescent.org  
with any suggestions you have.

GOALS AND ACTIVITIES

The focus of the programming aspect of the meeting will be to promote  
interoperability among online evolutionary databases through the  
following core set of activities.
1) Mapping the data and operation semantics of the participating  
online resources to an ontology, CDAO.
2) Implement a NeXML transformation for participating online resources  
as a formally defined query input and data output.
3) Implementation of programmable web-service interfaces following the  
emerging PhyloWS standard.
4) Showcase some of the possibilities that can arise from achieving  
data provider interoperability through small integration and/or mash- 
up oriented prototype applications.

Supporting activities will include discussing input from end-users,  
discussing compliance with emerging reporting standards (MIAPA) and  
documentation of solutions and open problems on the hackathon wiki.


ORGANIZATION

The event will be 5 days in duration and will take place at NESCent in  
Durham, North Carolina, on March 9-13, 2009. Participant travel,  
accommodation, expenses for meals, etc, will be paid by NESCent.  
Logistical and travel details will be communicated to accepted and  
confirmed participants.

The specific development targets will be selected by the participants  
through a hackathon wiki, a mailing list, and one or more conference  
calls. The exact agenda for the event will be developed similarly, but  
will be largely devoted to coding time. At the event itself,  
participants will self-organize into small subgroups (of 2-5) focused  
on particular targets.

The NeXML, CDAO, and PhyloWS standards are products of the  
Evolutionary Informatics working group (http://evoinfo.nescent.org),  
under the auspices of whom this event is being organized.


CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

We invite all individuals interested in attending to apply by  
responding to the questions below. We specifically encourage  
applications from members of underrepresented groups, specifically  
women and minorities, and from graduate students and postdocs.

1. Please indicate if you would be available for all or only for part  
of the March 9-13 time period.

2. All code and documentation produced at the event is to be made  
available immediately under an OSI-approved open-source license or a  
Creative Commons license. Please indicate if this would pose any  
difficulty for your participation.

3. Please briefly describe your qualifications (programming languages,  
metadata standards, experience with data schemas, web-service  
programming, mash-up programming, etc).

4. Please state what you would most like to accomplish at the  
hackathon, given your current understanding.  If you would not be  
writing software at the event, please state how you would like to  
contribute and how you would expect to benefit.

5. Please indicate if you are a member of an underrepresented group  
(including women, persons with disabilities, and any of the following  
minorities: African American, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska  
Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander).

To apply, please enter your personal information and your responses by  
February 5 into the online form at
http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p6ikV0To6fXpJ369ozyNSSw&hl=en

In addition, if possible please email a CV to the organizers at hackathon3@nescent.org 
  by the same deadline.  If you are interested in participating but  
are unable to respond in full by that deadline, please let us know as  
soon as possible. Please understand that the funds as well as the  
space for this event are limited. We also need to balance a critical  
mass of developers in certain areas of expertise with a broad  
participation of different data providers, and so not all qualified  
applicants can be guaranteed acceptance.

Yours,

The Organizing Committee

Hi Everyone,

it's been a while since the TDWG Meeting and workshop in Perth. Many  
of you on this list have participated in the workshop, and it was  
great to meet you there. I found the workshop to be productive and  
very encouraging towards forming this Interest Group in a way that has  
unique value.

You may have noticed that we have our own TDWG wiki site at

http://wiki.tdwg.org/Phylogenetics/

You can navigate there easily manually by going to the TDWG home page (http://tdwg.org 
), then click 'Wiki' in the left hand navigation bar, then  
'Phylogenetics'.

I've put up already last year some minimal initial content about what  
we are about, and I also put up information about and notes from our  
Perth workshop:

http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/PhylogeneticsStandardsWorkshop

While there hasn't been much activity since on the charter and the  
BioSynC proposal due to the I guess all too familiar year-end frenzy,  
this will change over the next few months. Stay tuned, we'll keep you  
in the loop. Also, this is meant to be a discussion much more than an  
announcement forum, so if you have any suggestions, concerns, or  
thoughts, please don't hesitate to voice them here.

Speaking of keeping in the loop, I'll shortly forward a call for  
participation in a NESCent-organized event that is very closely  
aligned with the phylogenetics standards and targeted at the  
interoperability issues we were talking about in Perth.

As for Markus' email, I don't know to what extent you have been part  
of the respective discussion but I wasn't. While I see the possible  
benefits of better avoiding the reinventing the wheel, I find the  
question of merging with another and much larger community when we  
aren't one really yet a bit premature, and I am concerned that the  
loss of focus might cause some to tune out or ignore the list (more  
than they might otherwise), which I find the much bigger risk than  
reinventing as the latter can be prevented by cross-talk and  
subscribing to multiple lists (which I'm used to, but again maybe not  
everyone is).

That's just my opinion though - please don't hesitate to voice yours,  
especially if you feel differently.

Cheers,

	-hilmar

Dear TDWG groups,

I would like to inform you about a new TDWG mailing list that was =20
created today for discussing any TDWG standard definitions on a non =20
technical level.
The new list was created to help cross pollination of ideas between =20
the different TDWG groups and avoid the frequent duplication of work =20
that we have encountered so often in the past years.

Every subgroup is free to decide whether they want to freeze their =20
existing mailing list and migrate discussions to the central tdwg-=20
content list. If you want to take this step, please let me know and I =20=

will take the required actions. A frozen mailing list will disallow =20
any new posts or member subscriptions, but the existing archive will =20
continue to be publicly available. An autoresponder will also be =20
configured to inform future users of the new content list. By default =20=

I will transfer all existing subscriptions to the new list, so people =20=

don't have to subscribe again.

You can also subscribe manually to the new mailing list here:
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content


In addition to that, the 3 existing mailing lists that deal with =20
technical issues have already decided to hold all discussions from now =20=

on on the technical architecture group (TAG) list. The existing guid =20
and tapir mailing lists have been frozen today.

Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring

Dear all--

At the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) meeting last month, a  
sub-group of the phylogenetic standards working group started a  
project to assess "current best practices for publishing trees  
electronically".   At present, probably the best way to publish a tree  
is to use the TreeBASE submission process, which makes it possible to  
upload a NEXUS file and create associations of OTUs with taxon IDs,  
and of data rows with accessions, and so on.  But there are also some  
other possibilities.  The preliminary report is being assembled here:

   http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/LinkingTrees2010

Our plan is (over the next 6 weeks) to get feedback on this  
preliminary report, then analyze the results and prepare a more  
extensive report for publication.

One possibility that we haven't examined yet is to publish a tree  
electronically by rendering it in RDF in the language of CDAO  
(Comparative Data Analysis Ontology) and then contributing it to the  
Linked-Open-Data cloud in some way.

Does anyone out there want to explore this idea and contribute the  
results to the TDWG project?   If so, please let me know.

Arlin

I am interested in the sense that I think that TreeBASE should publish
RDF renditions of its data in a LOD way.

Hi,

My name is Chris Baron - a software developer, computer science graduate
student interested in linked data, working in BioSync at the Field Museum on
tree visualization.  I have a few ideas on how to publish trees in RDF (have
even created a tool to do so) and would like to speak to Biologists about
how their data exists at publication so I can form a proper solution.

Chris--

It sounds like you have the skills and interest to do this.  Our first  
goal is very modest: just assess what's possible given currently  
available tools.   I only know about one so far, which will translate  
a file into CDAO with the option to add it to a triple store.  A web  
server interface is here:

   http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~cdaostore/phylows.php

If you know about other tools, that would be great.

The next step (weeks from now) would be to look ahead to the future  
and identify gaps.  If you are interested, all you need to do is to  
sign up for TDWG twiki access (if you don't have it already) and start  
working.

Apropos of this, a fascinating reporting on the LOD cloud was just  
released, as described in the message below.  Life science resources  
represent a sizable chunk of the cloud.

Subject: ANN: LOD Cloud - Statistics and compliance with best practices
To: "public-lod@w3.org" <public-lod@w3.org>


Hi all,

in the last weeks, we have analyzed which data sources in the new  
version of the LOD cloud comply to various best practices that are  
recommended by W3C or have emerged within the LOD community.

We have checked the implementation of the following nine best practices:

1. Provide dereferencable URIs
2. Set RDF links pointing at other data sources
3. Use terms from widely deployed vocabularies
4. Make proprietary vocabulary terms dereferencable
5. Map proprietary vocabulary terms to other vocabularies
6. Provide provenance metadata
7. Provide licensing metadata
8. Provide data-set-level metadata
9. Refer to additional access methods

The compliance with the best practices was either checked manually or  
by using scripts that downloaded and analyzed some data from the data  
sources.
We have added the results of the evaluation in the form of tags to the  
LOD data set catalog on CKAN [1].

We are now happy to release the first statistics about the structure  
of the LOD could as well as the compliance of the datasets with the  
best practices.
The statistics can be found here:

http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/lodcloud/state/

The document contains an initial, preliminary release of the  
statistics. If you spot any errors in the data describing the LOD data  
sets on CKAN, it would be great if you would correct them directly on  
CKAN.

For information on how to describe datasets on CKAN please refer to  
the Guidelines for Collecting Metadata on Linked Datasets in CKAN [2].

After your feedback and corrections, we will then move the corrected  
version of the statistics to http://www.lod-cloud.net/ (around October  
24th).

Have fun with the statistics and the encouraging as well as  
disappointing insights that they provide.

Cheers,

Chris Bizer, Anja Jentzsch and Richard Cyganiak

delsp=3Dyes<br> <br> Dear all--<br> <br> At the Biodiversity Information =
Standards (TDWG) meeting last month, a<br> sub-group of the phylogenetic =
standards working group started a<br> project to assess "current best =
practices for publishing trees<br> electronically". &nbsp; At present, =
probably the best way to publish a tree<br> is to use the TreeBASE =
submission process, which makes it possible to<br> upload a NEXUS file =
and create associations of OTUs with taxon IDs,<br> and of data rows =
with accessions, and so on. &nbsp;But there are also some<br> other =
possibilities. &nbsp;The preliminary report is being assembled here:<br> =

prepare a more<br> extensive report for publication.<br> <br> One =
possibility that we haven't examined yet is to publish a tree<br> =
electronically by rendering it in RDF in the language of CDAO<br> =

Yes, Triplify was the inspiration to the web2py plugin.

Also, I've been working on a phylogentic tree editor called tred.
http://code.google.com/p/tred/

Its still a little rough, but usable/stable.  Realizing that many Biologists
do not have their data in a relational database one could upload their
newick, nexus, etc to tred, edit the tree then export to CDAO.  I'd be happy
to add functionality to tred for this purpose if people will use it.

&gt;&gt; Dear all--<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; At the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) meeting last<br>
&gt;&gt; month, a<br>
&gt;&gt; sub-group of the phylogenetic standards working group started a<br=
>
&gt;&gt; project to assess &quot;current best practices for publishing tree=
s<br>
&gt;&gt; electronically&quot;. =A0 At present, probably the best way to pub=
lish a<br>
&gt;&gt; tree<br>
&gt;&gt; is to use the TreeBASE submission process, which makes it possible=
 to<br>
&gt;&gt; upload a NEXUS file and create associations of OTUs with taxon IDs=
,<br>
&gt;&gt; and of data rows with accessions, and so on. =A0But there are also=
 some<br>
&gt;&gt; other possibilities. =A0The preliminary report is being assembled =
here:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; =A0 <a href=3D"http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/L=
inkingTrees2010" target=3D"_blank">http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phyl=
ogenetics/LinkingTrees2010</a><br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Our plan is (over the next 6 weeks) to get feedback on this<br>
&gt;&gt; preliminary report, then analyze the results and prepare a more<br=
>
&gt;&gt; extensive report for publication.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; One possibility that we haven&#39;t examined yet is to publish a t=
ree<br>
&gt;&gt; electronically by rendering it in RDF in the language of CDAO<br>
&gt;&gt; (Comparative Data Analysis Ontology) and then contributing it to t=
he<br>
&gt;&gt; Linked-Open-Data cloud in some way.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Does anyone out there want to explore this idea and contribute the=
<br>
&gt;&gt; results to the TDWG project? =A0 If so, please let me know.<br>

Interesting. How does your editor compare to the dozens of tree  
editors and visualizers already available. For example PhyloWidget, or  
jsPhyloSVG?

I may sound like a broken record here, and I don't want to discourage  
you at all from developing tools for phylogenetics. We certainly need  
more developers. I also do think though that as a community we make  
the most progress if we aren't sprouting new tools for the same  
purpose all the time.

The purposes of tree visualization are many and varied, so it seems
natural to me that tool development reflects that diversity.  One
distinction of tred is that it exposes server-side and client-side
functionality.

I am yet to consider the visualizing RDF trees, however, I have am interest=
 in visualizing and interacting with trees and networks in a web context.

I've been looking at the various web tree visualizers, as well as more gene=
ric visualization libraries, for the last week or so. Understanding the fun=
ctionality, maturity, user community and inter-browser compatability is tim=
e consuming, and not always simple to determine.

Specifically, I am looking for a tool that supports, or can extended to sup=
port;

1. Both both trees and networks,
2. The selection of multiple nodes, e.g. subtrees
3. The browsing of large trees/networks - I get some weird effects with lar=
ge trees in jsPhyloSVG.=20
4. (Readable) Labels at all nodes.
5. Alternate layouts (circular, hyperbolic, etc.)
6. Works in as many browsers as possible.
7. A variety of I/O formats - I store my trees in PhyloDB, which I am think=
ing of generalizing for networks.

The ability to browse large trees seems to be a particular limitation of ex=
isting tools (I'd love to be corrected if I am wrong). Having a tree larger=
 than the widget, as in Phylowidget, is one approach, however, an overview =
window would be nice to orientate your view in relation to the entire tree.=
 I have also been considering displaying only a subset of nodes and then ha=
ving 'expand', 'contract' and 'pan' (by expanding and contracting) function=
s for navagation. The ability to display node subsets is probably more impo=
rtant for networks than trees as reticulation will often result in visual o=
cclusion.

I would be very interested in any comments regarding existing tools and the=
 above issues (an others I have not thought about). I would be happy to com=
pile all comments and perhaps some comparative demos somewhere.

Hi Dave,

er than the widget, as in Phylowidget, is one approach, however, an overvie=
w window would be nice to orientate your view in relation to the entire tre=

ons for navagation. The ability to display node subsets is probably more im=
portant for networks than trees as reticulation will often result in visual=
 occlusion.

Rod Page has coded a web widget (I believe all javascript) that has a
small preview window for the whole tree and a larger "zoomed in" view.
"TreeJuxtaposer" is a java app(let?) that allows you to contract and
expand selections of nodes/clades. I think these come closest to what
you are talking about, though neither operates on networks.

Cheers,

Rutger

David--

This raises two issues that I don't quite understand.

The problem of visualizing large trees, e.g., hundreds of thousands or  
millions of nodes, has been solved again and again by computer  
scientists.  We've all seen some visualizations of the internet done  
with such tools.  There is no fundamental technology barrier.  The  
technology exists to visualize large trees and zoom around and  
navigate and so on.

The problem has to do with how to develop stable and adaptable  
software for a community that is poor, dispersed, fractious (unable to  
agree on standards), and constantly changing in its needs.

Likewise, computer scientists and hackers have repeatedly solved the  
problem of designing a framework for automating bioinformatics  
workflows.  So why don't more bioinformaticians use automated workflows?

Probably the group that is getting closest to what you want is the  
TreeViz group of EoL at the Field Museum.   Karen Cranston (cc) has  
some cool slides on this.

The second issue that I don't understand is: what is the proper  
netiquette when a list message is cc'ed to half a dozen people?  If we  
all keep repeating the cc pattern, recipients may be getting lots of  
messages that they don't want.  If we stick to the list only, they  
could miss out.

Yes, except that Karen is now at NESCent :-) and she has been directly  
involved in an iPlant team working on a tree viewer that can  
efficiently read and display very large trees. She presented that back  
at the iEvoBio conference.

BTW Arlin - it didn't sound like such a solved problem according to  
the computer scientists involved in that project. But I'll leave it to  
Karen to comment further.

Keep everyone unless you have a good reason to drop someone (such as  
someone asking to be dropped :). BTW I think most if not all of those  
copied are on the list anyway (Rick - are you?).

PhyloDB can already deal with networks, or at least was designed that  
way - what made you think that it doesn't? Is there something missing?

Hi, Dave and Rutger:

My own tree viewer "Archaeopteryx" provides such an overview when zoomed 
in, plus some other features described as "missing" in most current tools.

See: http://www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/

Example: http://www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/examples/mollusca.html

Archaeopteryx also provides other useful features (at least for 
comparative genomics use cases). For example, the ability to infer 
internal taxonomies (if all external nodes have _some_ taxonomic 
information associated with them; standalone version only; via uniprot 
taxonomy database).

Please let me know if you'd like to know more or have suggestions for 
improvement (although keep in mind that this Archaeopteryx is just a 
peculiar hobby of mine).

Christian

Having a tree larger than the widget, as in Phylowidget, is one approach, however, an overview window would be nice to orientate your view in relation to the entire tree. I have also been considering displaying only a subset of nodes and then having 'expand', 'contract' and 'pan' (by expanding and contracting) functions for navagation. The ability to display node subsets is probably more important for networks than trees as reticulation will often result in visual occlusion.

QED.  The technology is out there.  IMHO, the continual propagation of  
new tree-viewers by developers, and the sense of users that there is  
no tree viewer that satisfies their needs, is (in the medium-term and  
long-term) a cultural-organizational-educational problem and not at  
all a technical problem.

If this is true, then in order to solve the real problem, we need to  
think about  things like changes in funding structure, standards  
development, and modes of user engagement, not new graphics libraries  
that do just the right thing with only a few commands.

Thank you Rutger, Christian, Cindy, Hilmar and Arlin,

Whatever the technological maturity of tools, there remains the hurdle of f=
inding the viewers, assessing their functionality and assessing whether a t=
ask can be completed with the available tools given a time-scale and skill =
set. I have just started to put together a comparison site describing funct=
ionality and where the same trees can be viewed in the different viewers.

Sorry for interrupting the RDF flow - it has been very interesting to follo=
w.

There are other issues here as well. Technology advances rapidly, and  
what once seemed a good choice may rapidly become dated. Without  
wishing to start a flame war, I think Java applets are dead (sorry  
Phylowidget), Flash is fading away (thank you Steve), and increasingly  
we will see lightweight SVG and Canvas-based browsers, non-web based  
browsers that exploit specific hardware (iPad anyone), and Google- 
Earth based browsers.

I doubt one-size-fits all will work. Standards themselves won't  
address this issue, and I personally doubt RDF is where we want to be  
focussing efforts anyway. A decent JSON format for trees and  
associated metadata would be much more palatable for developers. It's  
worth remembering that the great success of Newick (and Nexus) was  
largely due to the ease of parsing.

Regards

Rod

To clarify this-- I didn't mean to imply that there are no gaps.  In  
the *short-term*, there may be real gaps between what users want (or  
think they want) and what developers are providing and maintaining.   
I'm just saying that, by virtue of repeated failures, we should have  
learned by now that the way to close these gaps is NOT for the Nth  
independent developer to go out and developer the Mth independent tree  
viewer using the latest GUI fashions.

That sounds nice indeed, but frankly I've never seen it happen. The  
quick-and-dirty efforts that I have seen become standard parts of  
reusable and sustainable software have almost all started from their  
early beginnings as parts of reusable software. For a while rather  
experimental and unstable parts, obviously, but the future course was  
charted not as an afterthought.

Truth of the matter is that we're all scientists. No scientist is  
interested in, or gets promotion, scientific recognition, or  
publications from assembling entirely incompatible, mostly redundant  
except for a few features, quick-and-dirty pieces of software into  
some grand jack-of-all-trades software package.

My $0.02, from about 13 years of software engineering.

Both technology and users' needs evolve rapidly - so the "gaps" will
never be closed, at least in the time frame required by grants, etc.
Also, in phylogenetics a lot of developers are themselves users, so
quick and dirty solutions to scratch individual itches is inevitable.
It's a good thing, IMO.

Inevitable. Good thing inded. But not enough to make significant =
progress and fill the gaps. I agree with Hilmar.

I agree entirely with the "solutions to scratch individual itches is  
inevitable and a Good Thing(tm)".

What I don't agree with is if this is portrayed as being mutually  
exclusive with reusable and more sustainable software. Projects like  
Bioconductor, the Bio* libraries, and other similar ones demonstrate  
that it clearly does not need to be mutually exclusive if we don't  
want it to be. Every piece of code in BioPerl is there because it  
first scratched someone's itch. The rate of innovation in Bioconductor  
is pretty rapid.

The barrier, if there is perceived to be one, is social, not technical  
or scientific. If we as a community of practice don't care about  
sustainable software, it won't happen, and we'll continue to lose  
software. If we want to think that the software we produce is an  
integral part of our science, we lose part of our science every time a  
piece of software is no longer maintained. And if we want to think  
that writing a new piece of software is part of our scientific  
progress, then every time someone writes code for something that code  
has already been written for, our rate of scientific progress is  
slowed down unnecessarily.

Again, just my own $0.02.

This discussion doesn't really belong here, but I'm not sure where  
else it belongs, and I sure would hate to stop, because its  
interesting and valuable.

Hilmar, are you referring to various quick-and-dirty BioPerl modules,  
for instance, as cases in which software that ended up being reusable  
started out as part of a reusable software package?  Are there other  
kinds of contexts where this would work?  How could we get different  
developers working on the same architecture, building a shared  
foundation but creating different solutions from it?

One idea used in nexplorer3 (and in some other viewers) is a Model- 
View-Controller design pattern that separates the business logic from  
the user interface.

It seems to me that ATV has been pretty successful. I've seen half a  
dozen sites that use it (that's a success by my standards).

Are there any ideas for getting phylogentic data into CDAO format ?

Its probably a bad idea to choose one existing viewer, add the
functionality, and ask everyone to use it.  Apologies for the proposition.

I'll suggest a web based tool that takes phylogenetic data in a common
format ( Newick, Nexus, etc ), asks a few questions ( i.e. - what do the
labels, lengths correspond to? ), and fills in some of the basic CDAO
elements using this data.  If the user wants to describe their tree in more
detail, the tool will provide methods for filling in any/all of the CDAO
fields.

sing this data.=A0 If the user wants to describe their tree in more detail,=
 the tool will provide methods for filling in any/all of the CDAO fields.<b=

Whatever the technological maturity of tools, there remains the hurdle of f=

There are other issues here as well. Technology advances rapidly, and<br>
what once seemed a good choice may rapidly become dated. Without<br>
wishing to start a flame war, I think Java applets are dead (sorry<br>
Phylowidget), Flash is fading away (thank you Steve), and increasingly<br>
we will see lightweight SVG and Canvas-based browsers, non-web based<br>
browsers that exploit specific hardware (iPad anyone), and Google-<br>
Earth based browsers.<br>
<br>
I doubt one-size-fits all will work. Standards themselves won&#39;t<br>
address this issue, and I personally doubt RDF is where we want to be<br>
focussing efforts anyway. A decent JSON format for trees and<br>
associated metadata would be much more palatable for developers. It&#39;s<b=
r>
worth remembering that the great success of Newick (and Nexus) was<br>
largely due to the ease of parsing.<br>

True.. but another aspect is just that in order to explore whether a partic=

<br>
- Do we really have a completely satisfying way of visualizing patterns of =

- If I handed you a tree with 200k nodes, is there a visual / GUI way that =

- =A0If I gave you 1,000 trees, is there a visual / GUI way that would allo=
w you to see which branches in each tree probably crossed an ancient land b=
ridge together?<br>
<br>
So I think we still have lots more GUI / visual / ergonomic challenges that=
 still need to be solved (even if lots of challenges have already been solv=
ed). And we should not expect each new idea to be implemented in a pristine=

That sounds nice indeed, but frankly I&#39;ve never seen it happen. The<br>
quick-and-dirty efforts that I have seen become standard parts of<br>
reusable and sustainable software have almost all started from their<br>
early beginnings as parts of reusable software. For a while rather<br>
experimental and unstable parts, obviously, but the future course was<br>
charted not as an afterthought.<br>
<br>
Truth of the matter is that we&#39;re all scientists. No scientist is<br>
interested in, or gets promotion, scientific recognition, or<br>
publications from assembling entirely incompatible, mostly redundant<br>
except for a few features, quick-and-dirty pieces of software into<br>
some grand jack-of-all-trades software package.<br>

<br>
<br>
I agree entirely with the &quot;solutions to scratch individual itches is<b=
r>
inevitable and a Good Thing(tm)&quot;.<br>
<br>
What I don&#39;t agree with is if this is portrayed as being mutually<br>
exclusive with reusable and more sustainable software. Projects like<br>
Bioconductor, the Bio* libraries, and other similar ones demonstrate<br>
that it clearly does not need to be mutually exclusive if we don&#39;t<br>
want it to be. Every piece of code in BioPerl is there because it<br>
first scratched someone&#39;s itch. The rate of innovation in Bioconductor<=
br>
is pretty rapid.<br>
<br>
The barrier, if there is perceived to be one, is social, not technical<br>
or scientific. If we as a community of practice don&#39;t care about<br>
sustainable software, it won&#39;t happen, and we&#39;ll continue to lose<b=
r>
software. If we want to think that the software we produce is an<br>
integral part of our science, we lose part of our science every time a<br>
piece of software is no longer maintained. And if we want to think<br>
that writing a new piece of software is part of our scientific<br>
progress, then every time someone writes code for something that code<br>
has already been written for, our rate of scientific progress is<br>
slowed down unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
Again, just my own $0.02.<br>

br>
else it belongs, and I sure would hate to stop, because its<br>
interesting and valuable.<br>
<br>
Hilmar, are you referring to various quick-and-dirty BioPerl modules,<br>
for instance, as cases in which software that ended up being reusable<br>
started out as part of a reusable software package? =A0Are there other<br>
kinds of contexts where this would work? =A0How could we get different<br>
developers working on the same architecture, building a shared<br>
foundation but creating different solutions from it?<br>
<br>
One idea used in nexplorer3 (and in some other viewers) is a Model-<br>
View-Controller design pattern that separates the business logic from<br>
the user interface.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that ATV has been pretty successful. I&#39;ve seen half a<br=

dozen sites that use it (that&#39;s a success by my standards).<br>

I never suggested this, but it seemed there was a sentiment that
scratching on the part of individual developers was a bad thing -
counterproductive to some common goal - and should be discouraged.
That struck me as odd.  I do agree that modularity and reusability
should indeed be encouraged, e.g. in educating user-developers in MVC
design patterns and library-based development.

Currently, the best way to get data into CDAO is via XSLT-mediated XML  
translation from NeXML files to CDAO RDF-XML files.  This is  
developmental software that is very incomplete.  However, its possible  
to take translated files and display them using Nexplorer3 (http://exon.niaid.nih.gov/nexplorer/ 
), a viewer based on CDAO.

There are many ways to get data into NeXML, including applications  
such as Mesquite, toolboxes such as Bio::Phylo and DendroPy, and a  
phylogeny archive called TreeBASE that accepts published submissions.   
TreeBASE produces NeXML and also can generate CDAO RDF-XML files from  
them.

 From where I'm standing, that's a really promising development  
target.  The most obvious kinds of metadata that we would want to add  
to the core tree structure are

1. citation information, especially authorship
2. species identifiers or other taxonomic concept identifiers (LSIDs,  
NCBI taxon ids, etc)
3. accession numbers for data sources (GenBank or other accessions)
4. geographic coordinates
5. methods information

The TreeBASE submission process provides a web-based interface to do  
all of this.  One uploads a NEXUS file and then supplies publication  
info, matches species names, supplies methods info, etc.  I strongly  
suggest that you check it out.  You can load data just for testing  
purposes without actually publishing it.

All this cool stuff goes INTO the TreeBASE schema, but only some of it  
comes OUT in the form of NeXML.  For instance, NeXML uses a prism- 
based encoding of citation information, but it doesn't encode  
accession numbers.

So, to do what you are proposing, which is a great idea, would involve  
working with the community to implement existing standards and figure  
out any missing ones.  There is a TDWG standard with supporting  
language for #4 (geo coordinates).  There are other standards, e.g.,  
dc and prism, for #1 (citations).  One could use a UBio LSID for #2 if  
its a species identifier, though I've seen various ways of doing  
this.   Likewise, there are ways to do #3 (accessions) but not a  
recognized standard.  The phylogenetic community needs #5 (methods  
annotation) but has made no tangible progress on this.

There are other issues here as well. Technology advances rapidly, =
and<br> what once seemed a good choice may rapidly become dated. =
Without<br> wishing to start a flame war, I think Java applets are dead =
(sorry<br> Phylowidget), Flash is fading away (thank you Steve), and =
increasingly<br> we will see lightweight SVG and Canvas-based browsers, =
non-web based<br> browsers that exploit specific hardware (iPad anyone), =

anyway. A decent JSON format for trees and<br> associated metadata would =

And the point here (just to be clear) is not that NeXML couldn't  
represent all of this.  Its not a problem with NeXML.  The problem is  
that representing it properly relies on 1) a standard with 2) a  
language and encoding.  The Sequence Ontology presumably has some way  
of encoding accession numbers, and NeXML could use the SO namespace  
for this purpose.  Ideally, NeXML might use some more generic concept  
of accession from CDAO or elsewhere, because in evolutionary  
comparative analysis, the accession might be a GenBank accession for a  
sequence, or it might be a museum accession for a tissue sample or a  
skull.

I think I gave some examples in my other email. The key is that  
contributing be openly welcome, have very little barriers that aren't  
directly related to the code itself, and have an advantage for the  
developer. The advantage, for example, to adding on to BioPerl is that  
as a developer there's an awful lot of code I can easily reuse for all  
the mundane stuff, my code will be seen by and be useful to a lot more  
people, and I can be part of a community that I can learn from or  
exchange ideas with.

To all those interested in archiving, sharing, re-use, etc of trees (w  
data & metadata)--

At the TDWG meeting in Woods Hole 2 months ago, the phylogenetic  
standards interest group spawned a sub-group (Dan Rosauer, Torsten  
Eriksson, Jamie Whitacre, Elena Herzog and myself) committed to a  
project to assess current best practices for publishing a phylogenetic  
tree electronically.   This project is very timely as several major  
evolution journals have now announced that in January 2011 they will  
require archiving of data including phylogenetic trees.

Since then, we've done a considerable amount of work that is reflected  
in drafts of an online report, and of a user survey.  Our intention is  
to release a preliminary report, send out the survey to get systematic  
feedback from a broad community of tree-makers and tree-users, then  
write a more complete report for publication.  The draft report and  
survey are available here:

   http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/LinkingTrees2010
   https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHhZa0xMQTJuR0ZCZWxoV2JSTG13b2c6MQ

At present, it does not seem that this will be done in time to release  
the report in 2010.  However, delaying until January will give us time  
to improve the report.

Please let me know if you have suggestions about how to improve the  
report, or if you would like to contribute more directly (i.e., by  
joining the project and doing some research and writing).

By way of fair warning, currently this is a "TDWG phylogenetic  
standards interest group" project, but if there is not enough energy  
in our interest group to finish this in a timely manner-- and so far  
there isn't-- I'm inclined to peddle this project more widely to get  
collaborators.  Thanks for your time,

Arlin

Dear list,

Having already noted on Twitter that this list is rather quiet,
I thought I'd post something to (hopefully) generate debate:

As a student primarily concerned with palaeo-morpho-phylo data, 
I'm rather disheartened by the lack of progress in data archiving and publishing standards, particularly in the palaeontological research community.

What's worse is. I get the feeling (some) people just don't care.
They can seem oblivious to the benefits. Ignorant to the lost re-purposing potential.

A tiny few evolution and ecology journals have recently changed editorial policy for the better -> So what?
These journals are a just a drop in the ocean of what's out there that publish phylogenetic analyses, particularly palaeo-phylo analyses.

How many systematic palaeontologists know or care about ontologies and/or XML-schema?

It's all fine and well creating wonderfully clever linked architectures for data, but if the primary data-producers don't know about them, nor want the additional 'hassle' (no matter how little hassle it is), these brilliant data-networks may remain relatively empty.

Community-change is needed, first-and-foremost I argue. The question I ask is how?


Regards,

Ross

PS
I find it gratingly ironic that Palaeontologists have an extremely faithfully updated public database for taxonomic and stratigraphic occurrence records: http://paleodb.org/
Why are MorphoBank and/or TreeBASE not as popular?

Registration is now open for the conference on Informatics for  
Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/register.html 
  .

iEvoBio aims to be a forum bringing together biologists working in  
evolution, systematics, and biodiversity, with software developers and  
mathematicians. The goal of iEvoBio is both to catalyse the  
development of new tools, and to increase awareness of the  
possibilities offered by existing technologies (ranging from standards  
and reusable toolkits to mega-scale data analysis to rich  
visualization). The inaugural meeting in 2010 (see http://ievobio.org/2010) 
  attracted over 300 participants.

The 2-day meeting will take place June 21-22, 2011, in Norman, OK,  
jointly with the 2011 Evolution Meetings as a satellite conference.   
The event will feature traditional elements, including a keynote  
presentation at the beginning of each day and contributed talks, as  
well as more dynamic and interactive elements, including a challenge,  
lightning talk-style sessions, a software bazaar, and Birds-of-a- 
Feather gatherings.

The topic of this year's challenge is Data Integration.  Cash prizes  
will be awarded for first place ($1,000) and runner-up entries.  The  
winning entries will be selected by a vote of the iEvoBio meeting  
participants.  More details about the challenge will be provided in a  
separate announcement.

Attendees can register jointly for Evolution and iEvoBio at a  
discount, or only for the iEvoBio conference. For more information  
about registration, venue, travel, or accommodations please visit the  
Evolution 2011 website at http://www.evolution2011.ou.edu/.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org. You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/ 
iEvoBio , or subscribe to the low-traffic iEvoBio announcements  
mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ievobio-announce

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society for the Study of Evolution  
(SSE) and the Systematic Biologists (SSB). Additional support has been  
provided by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL).

Dear all--

After months of effort by a dedicated few (Jamie Whitacre & I), we are  
near to releasing a preliminary report on current best practices for  
publishing phylogenetic trees (1), and a survey designed to complete  
the report and assess user needs (2).  The draft report is a product  
of the TDWG phylogenetic standards interest group, while the survey is  
from the MIAPA list participants.

Its a great time to be doing this.  Ready or not, in the next few  
years, the phylogenetics community is going to be forced (by journal  
policies) to archive tens of thousands of trees.  Ideally, we can use  
this opportunity to catch a wave of interest in archiving, synthesis,  
and integration, and leverage the power of this wave to gain funding  
and to energize a community effort.

But, to be successful, this is going to require more of a team effort.

I'm excited about this project, but before I will commit to going  
ahead with it, I need commitments from 6 people, each one willing to  
dedicate 15 hours (over the next 6 weeks) to disseminate the survey,  
analyze results, and follow up on feedback and queries.  These 6  
people will be authors on the final published report on best practices  
for publishing a phylogenetic tree, and will have any other advantages  
that accrue from being part of this effort.

Let me know if you want to be one of those people.  Regards,

Arlin

Hi Ross,

your email has been burning in my inbox for a while now, and just because
you haven't had any replies yet doesn't mean nobody's listening :)

What's worse is. I get the feeling (some) people just don't care.

The first people to adopt standards aren't going to reap the rewards (that
much). It'd be good for everyone if everyone else did it, but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's good for one person to start doing it (I guess we all
know the equivalents of this in game theory and group selection).

(Apologies if you get multiple copies of this.)

The Call for Abstracts for full talks is now open for the 2011  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at
http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2011. See below for  
instructions.

Accepted talks will be about 15-20 minutes in length and will be  
presented during the full talk sessions in the morning of each of the  
two conference days, following the day's keynote presentation.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at  
advancing research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity,  
including new tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data  
analysis, and visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long.  
The abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject.  As the  
number of program slots for full talks is limited, the abstract should  
give enough detail so reviewers can decide whether the submission  
merits a full talk or whether it should be moved to one of the  
Lightning Talk sessions.  If the subject of the talk is a specific  
software component for use by the research community, the abstract  
must state the license and give the URL where the source code is  
available so reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*)  
is met.

The deadline for submission is March 18, 2011. We intend to notify  
authors of accepted talks before early registration for iEvoBio (and  
Evolution) ends. Further instructions for submission are at the  
following URL:

http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2011/schedConf/cfp

Full talks are 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that iEvoBio will  
feature. The other 4 are: 1) Lightning talks (5 mins long), 2)  
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of- 
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries is already open  
(see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html). The calls for contribution to  
the other 3 sessions will open later, and will remain open until  
shortly before the conference or until the respective track fills up.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/ 
iEvoBio , or subscribe to the low-traffic iEvoBio announcements  
mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ievobio-announce

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society for the Study of Ecolution  
(SSE) and the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB). Additional  
support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL).


The iEvoBio 2011 Organizing Committee:
Rob Guralnick (University of Colorado at Boulder) (Co-chair)
Cynthia Parr (Encyclopedia of Life) (Co-chair)
Dawn Field (UK National Environmental Research Center)
Mark Holder (University of Kansas)
Hilmar Lapp (NESCent)
Rod Page (University of Glasgow)

(*) iEvoBio and its sponsors are dedicated to promoting the practice  
and philosophy of Open Source software development (see http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) 
  and reuse within the research community. For this reason, if a  
submitted talk concerns a specific software system for use by the  
research community, that software must be licensed with a recognized  
Open Source License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be  
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file  
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control  
system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.  Authors of  
full talks who cannot meet this requirement at the time of submission  
should state their intentions, and are advised that the requirement  
must be met by June 19, 2011, at the latest.

(Apologies if you receive multiple copies.)

Over the next 3 weeks we will be pulling together NESCent's  
application to the 2011 Google Summer of Code as a mentoring  
organization. This is a call for all prospective mentors, primary and  
secondary, to step forward.

Participating as an organization is competitive. Over the last years  
the acceptance rate for organizations has been around 30-35%. The most  
important component of organization applications is the Ideas page,  
and specifically the quality and suitability of the project ideas.  
These project ideas are contributed by you, our mentors. In the past  
we have had a strong, diverse and well-documented portfolio of ideas  
with different degrees of difficulty, from different participating  
open-source projects, using different programming languages.

If you can fancy yourself serving as a mentor, or helping someone else  
mentoring a student as a secondary mentor, or would like to help out  
in other capacities, please contact us as soon as you can at phylosoc-admin@nescent.org 
. If you have not been a mentor with us in previous years, we'll send  
you guidance on what doing so involves, and how you can contribute to  
our participation. We will also add everyone who is interested in  
serving to our (private) mentors mailing list (at least those who  
aren't already).

If you are new to Summer of Code and wonder what it takes or what it  
is like to be a mentor for us, don't hesitate to ask questions or to  
contact previous mentors (see URLs below for projects that got  
selected). Being a mentor does require time (see http://bit.ly/soc2011-mentortime) 
, but our past mentors have pretty much unanimously found it a fun and  
rewarding experience. That's aside from the code a student could  
contribute to your project, and, possibly most important of all in the  
long run, the chance to gain a new developer.

The initial skeleton of our 2011 Ideas page is now up here and ready  
for adding project ideas and mentors(*).

http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2011

We will send further guidance on drafting project ideas, but for now  
you can see examples of the format and scope of project ideas on the  
Ideas pages from previous years (click on "Ideas"):

http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2010
http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009
http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2008
http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2007

Dates:
======

Submission of organization applications starts Feb 28 and closes on  
March 11. For project ideas to contribute to the strength of our  
application they must be in reasonable shape by the morning of March  
11. *If* we are accepted, ideas can be refined (or added) between  
March 18-27.

Students apply March 28-April 8, and selected students are announced  
April 25. The coding period runs from May 23 to August 22. See
http://bit.ly/soc2011-timeline for a full timeline of the whole program.

Cheers, and we look forward to hearing from you!

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2011

http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2011

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a mentoring  
organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http://code.google.com/soc/ 
).

Students in the program will receive a stipend from Google (and  
possibly more importantly, a T-shirt solely available to successful  
participants), and may work from their home, or home institution, for  
the duration of the 3 month program. Each student will have at least  
one dedicated mentor to show them the ropes and help them complete  
their project.

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. Initial project ideas  
are listed on the website. These range from visualizing viral  
epidemics to 3D protein structure evolution, rich annotation for  
TreeBASE content, exposing phenotype observations to the Encyclopedia  
of Life, to enhancing R packages for phylogenetic analysis. All  
project ideas are flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match  
the skills of the student.  We also welcome novel project ideas that  
dovetail with student interests.

TO APPLY: Apply online at the Google Summer of Code website (http://socghop.appspot.com/ 
), where you will also find GSoC  program rules and eligibility  
requirements.  Each organization has a slightly different application  
format, and ours is at http://bit.ly/PhyloSoC2011-apptemplate. The 12- 
day application period for students opens on Monday, March 28th, and  
runs through Friday, April 8th, 2011.

INQUIRIES: phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly encourage all  
interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early  
on as possible. Working closely with potential mentors to develop your  
project proposal greatly increases your chance for acceptance. Do not  
underestimate the amount of time it takes to develop a competitive

This year, iEvoBio will have a special focus Session on Metagenomics,  
Barcoding, and Biodiversity and the challenges that these new  
approaches raise for evolutionary informatics.  We now have over 6000  
genomes and vast quantities of metagenomic sequences in the public  
domain, primarily from bacteria and archaea from many habitats.  
Various short sequences (e.g. barcodes) for quick identification of  
eukaryotes are emerging.  The availability of this sequence data and  
ever-cheaper methods for producing it offer exciting opportunities  
forunderstanding molecular evolution and biodiversity. However, the  
data are growing faster than the infrastructure to support it.  
Moreover, the eukaryotic and microbial informatics communities have  
independent histories and approaches, so synergy is not easy. These  
challenges typify the intersection of fields that are the scope of  
iEvoBio. Invited speakers in this special session include Neil Davies (http://moorea.berkeley.edu/aboutus/people/ndavies 
) from the Moorea Biocode project, Linda Amarral-Zettler (http://amarallab.mbl.edu/ 
) from the Marine Biological Laboratory Wood's Hole, and Holly Bik,  
from the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies at the University of New  
Hampshire.  After the talks, there will be an open panel with all the  
speakers, including keynote speaker Dawn Field (http://ceh.academia.edu/DawnField 
) from the Center for Ecology and Hydrology at Oxford.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society for the Study of Ecolution  
(SSE) and the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB). Additional  
support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL).

The Call for Lightning Talks is now open for the 2011 conference on  
Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio),  
at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2011. See below for  
instructions.

Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes. They are ideal  
for drawing the attention of the audience to new developments, tools,  
and resources, or to subsequent events where more in-depth information  
can be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more information (http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning 
). Lightning talks will be part of the more interactive afternoon  
program on both conference days.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at  
advancing research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity,  
including new tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data  
analysis, and visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long.   
The abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject.   
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the  
conference (see above). If applicable, the abstract must also state  
the license and give the URL where the source code is available so  
reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.

Review and acceptance of lightning talks will be on a rolling basis.   
The deadline for submission is the morning of the first day of the  
conference (June 21). Note that the number of lightning talk slots is  
finite, and given the high volume of submissions we experienced for  
full talks, the Lightning Talks track may fill up early. We cannot  
accept lightning talks until the open-source requirements are met, and  
so waiting with that until the deadline risks that the track is full  
by that time.

We ask all submitters of lightning talks to be willing to also serve  
as reviewers of such, as described above.

Lightning talks are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that  
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2)  
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of-  
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries remains open (see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) 
, and information on the Software Bazaar and Birds-of-a-Feather  
sessions is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

  and reuse within the research community. For this reason, if a  
submitted talk concerns a specific software system for use by the  
research community, that software must be licensed with a recognized  
Open Source License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be  
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file  
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control  
system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.

The conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio) is holding a Challenge, a competition to create  
a new software tool, or add a new feature to an existing platform.  
Entries to the Challenge need to respond to its theme, which for 2011  
is "Data Integration".

Improving our understanding of the evolution of life requires  
combining data sets from a wide variety of disparate sources. Thus,  
data integration poses a serious challenge for evolutionary research.  
Entries for the 2011 iEvoBio challenge must enable new approaches to  
data interoperability or represent an exceptional example of  
integrating existing sources of data.

Further information on the nature of challenge entries and how to  
submit them can be found on the iEvoBio website at http://ievobio.org/challenge.html 
. Selected candidates will make short oral presentations to  
demonstrate their work in a "Challenge session" at the conference, and  
if suitable will automatically be entered into the Software Bazaar  
track of the conference.

Cash prizes will be awarded for first place ($1,000) and runner-up  
entries.  The winning entries will be selected by a vote of the  
iEvoBio meeting participants.

Challenge entries are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that  
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2)  
Lightning talks, 3) Software Bazaar entries, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather  
gatherings. The Call for Lightning Talks is currently open (see http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2011/) 
, and the information on Software Bazaar entries is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous

The Call for Software Bazaar entries is now open for the 2011  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/ 
2011. See below for instructions.

The Software Bazaar features presenters demonstrating their software  
live on a laptop. At iEvoBio, this session takes the place of a poster  
session, and will be approximately 2.0 hours in duration. Conference  
attendees will be able to walk from one demonstration to the next and  
open a conversation with the presenters.  Please also see our FAQ for  
this information (http://ievobio.org/faq.html#software). The Software  
Bazaar is part of the interactive afternoon program on the first  
conference day.

Entries should be software aimed at advancing research in  
phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, and can include  
interactive visualizations that have been pre-computed (such as SVGs,  
or Google Earth-compatible KML files).

Submissions consist of a title, which will typically be the name of  
the software (or visualization method) being presented, the URL of a  
website where more information about the software can be obtained, and  
the license under which the source code is available. The provided  
website must contain a link to where the source code (and possibly  
binaries) can be downloaded. If it is not obvious from the provided  
website, the submission must describe what the software does.  
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the  
conference (see above), and need to be able to verify whether the open- 
source requirement(*) is met.

Presenters are expected to bring their own laptops for presentation,  
and any auxiliary devices necessary (such as a mouse). Power will be  
available at the presentation tables (110V/60Hz, US-style plugs;  
international presenters need to bring a suitable adaptor). Please let  
the organizing committee know as much in advance as possible if you  
expect to have unusually high demands for wireless network bandwidth,  
a large display, or other hardware. Note that commercial marketing  
activities are not permitted - presenters wishing to promote  
commercial or proprietary services or products should contact the  
Evolution conference about exhibitor space.

Review and acceptance of Software Bazaar submissions will be on a  
rolling basis. The deadline for submission is the morning of the first  
day of the conference (June 21). As the number of Software Bazaar  
presentation slots is finite, we cannot guarantee the availability of  
slots up until the day of the conference. We cannot accept submissions  
until the open-source requirements are met.

We ask all submitters of Software Bazaar presentations to be willing  
to also serve as reviewers of such, as described above.

Software Bazaar demonstrations are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed  
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks  
(closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3) Challenge entries, and 4) Birds-of-a- 
Feather gatherings. The Calls for Challenge entries (http://ievobio.org/challenge.html 
) and Lightning Talks (same submission URL as above) remain open, and  
information on the Birds-of-a-Feather session is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

version control system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or  
Mercurial.  Authors are advised that non-compliant submissions must be  
revised to meet the requirement by June 21 at the latest, and in the  
event that presentation slots run out, precedence is established by  
the date they are first found in compliance, not the date of submission.

In anticipation of the 2011 conference on Informatics for  
Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), we solicit all  
attendees to propose and discuss Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. See  
below for details.

Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings (BoFs) are informal, ad-hoc, focused  
face-to-face discussion groups that form around a shared interest.  
BoFs can also take the form of a hands-on software tutorial on using a  
tool, or on programming an API. BoFs have a leader (usually, but not  
necessarily, the proposer) who initiates or moderates the discussion.  
The topics of BoFs can range widely, including general cultural or  
computational infrastructure issues, or narrower questions such as how  
to make the best use of a particular software tool or how to solve a  
particular computational challenge.

Anyone willing to lead such a group can propose a BoF. iEvoBio will  
provide space that can accommodate up to 8-10 BoFs. Sign-up sheets  
will be provided on-site on the first day of the conference where  
attendees can propose a BoF or sign up for one proposed by someone  
else. BoFs will be about 1-1.5 hours in duration and take place in the  
afternoon of the second day of the conference.

In line with their informal nature, there is no official prior call  
for or submission of BoFs. However, we encourage those intending to  
propose one to sound out or rally potential attendees ahead of time.  
We suggest to employ Twitter (http://twitter.com) for this, using the  
#ievobioBof tag to mark BoF proposals and comments. Similarly, users  
interested in seeing a hands-on tutorial BoF about their favorite tool  
are encouraged to use similar means to give tool developers a sense of  
the community interest in a tutorial BoF, and what common usage (or  
programming) questions are.

TDWG MIAPA Workshop
Call For Participation:
Steps towards a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis =
(MIAPA) Standard
Synopsis

Many phylogenetic analysis results are published in ways that present =
serious barriers to their reuse in numerous research applications that =
would stand to benefit from them. While some of these barriers are well =
understood, such as issues with adherence to standard exchange formats, =
those centering on the associated metadata necessary for researchers to =
evaluate or reuse a published phylogeny have only recently begun to be =
articulated. One of the critical next steps towards formalizing these =
metadata requirements as a minimum reporting standard is to convene =
meetings of key stakeholder communities with the goal to identify =
information attributes  necessary and desirable for facilitating reuse, =
and to build consensus on their priority. To this end, we are holding a =
workshop at the 2011 Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) =
Conference to determine how a future reporting standard for phylogenetic =
analyses can best serve biodiversity science and related research =
applications.  We invite all interested colleagues to participate.
Background

The workshop of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) =
Phylogenetics Standards Interest Group held at the 2010 TDWG conference =
included a project focused on how to publish re-usable trees that can be =
linked into an emerging global web of data.  Through follow-up work, =
this led to the following tangible results:
An online draft report of the 2010 TDWG workshop [1], and a =
corresponding manuscript on best practices for publishing phylogenetic =
trees (Stoltzfus et al. in preparation);
An 2011 iEvoBio presentation on =93Publishing re-usable phylogenetic =
trees, in theory and in practice=94 [2];
A lighting talk presentation and Birds-of-a-Feather gathering at 2011 =
iEvoBio, and
A survey group that explored barriers to re-use and developed plans for =
a survey
These activities have considerably clarified our understanding of the =
theory and practice of publishing re-usable phylogenetic trees: how many =
phylogenies are published each year, the (low) frequency of archiving, =
what archives and tools are available, what policies are in force, etc.  =
We have identified a number of barriers to re-use involving such aspects =
as technology, standards, culture, and access. =20
Many of these barriers can be interpreted as a consequence of the lack =
of a community-agreed standard for what constitutes a well documented =
phylogenetic record.  In the absence of such a standard, trees are often =
archived as image files rather than in appropriate data exchange =
formats, and lack important accompanying information (metadata), such as =
externally meaningful identifiers, that would be needed to make them =
useful to others. The idea of a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic =
Analysis (MIAPA) standard has been suggested [3], but so far there has =
not been a deliberate process to develop and disseminate a community =
standard.  Meanwhile, a number of systematics and evolution journals =
have begun to require archiving of the data underlying published =
research findings [4].  The emerging cultural shift in data archiving =
and sharing promoted by this policy change offers a unique window of =
opportunity to move ahead with the development and actual specification =
of a MIAPA standard.
Similar to other minimum reporting standards [5], the primary focus of a =
future MIAPA standard would be on defining a =93checklist=94 of metadata =
information attributes that, at a minimum, needs to accompany an =
archived phylogenetic analysis, and to which standards values for these =
attributes would need to adhere. The key step in developing community =
consensus on these elements of the standard is to convene a series of =
meetings that collectively involve participants from all major groups of =
stakeholders who would be affected by such a standard, such as users, =
producers, publishers, or archivists of phylogenetic analyses.  To aid =
this process, the Phylogenetics Standards Interest Group is holding a =
workshop at the 2011 TDWG conference, with the goal to obtain consensus =
requirements and priorities for a MIAPA checklist for the purposes of =
biodiversity science, taxonomy, museum collections, and related research =
applications.
Goals and deliverables

The main goal of the workshop is to develop a shared understanding of =
the role that a MIAPA standard could play in facilitating re-use of =
phylogenetic analyses for the biodiversity science and related =
communities, and what the standard would need to specify in order to  =
best fill that role. Possible deliverables include
A draft set of information attributes that should or could be included =
in a provisional MIAPA checklist, with a level of consensus for each of =
them.
A database with use-cases based on exemplifying publications, that =
report phylogenies to elucidate a broad spectrum of questions relating =
to biodiversity science.
A refined MIAPA survey to be informed by biodiversity science cases for =
reuse.
A plan for further community engagement and consensus-building among =
biodiversity science stakeholders.
Workshop format

The workshop will start with a few presentations focused on (i) =
introducing MIAPA and its potential in facilitating reuse (J. =
Leebens-Mack); (ii) summarizing recent developments and current status =
of MIAPA-related efforts (A. Stoltzfus); and (iii) past experiences and =
resulting best practice recommendations on developing a minimum =
reporting checklist standard (D. Field). The rest of the workshop will =
be hands-on.  Participants in the workshop will break out into groups to =
address separate issues according to the anticipated deliverables and =
best practice recommendations.
The workshop will be 1.5 days in duration, and be held during the 2011 =
Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) conference, to take place Oct =
17 to 21, 2011 in New Orleans, USA. =
(http://www.tdwg.org/conference2011/).  The workshop will start in the =
afternoon of Monday, Oct 17, and end on Tuesday. Oct 18.
How to participate

Participation in the workshop is open to everyone interested. However, =
space is limited, and we therefore ask that, if you are interested in =
attending, to please communicate your interest through the MIAPA =
discussion group [6]. This will also allow us to include you in =
pre-workshop planning. Since the workshop is part of the TDWG =
conference, participants will need to register either for the full =
conference, or for the days of the workshop. =20
The organizers will provide an electronic venue for participants to =
share ideas and develop plans in advance of the workshop.  After the =
initial presentations, participants will self-organize into task groups. =

With the workshop less than a month away, it might be a good time to =20
start getting organized.  Do we have any way of knowing who is going =20
to attend, other than the usual suspects?

> Phylogenetics Standards Interest Group held at the 2010 TDWG =20
> conference included a project focused on how to publish re-usable =20
> trees that can be linked into an emerging global web of data.  =20
> Through follow-up work, this led to the following tangible results:
> An online draft report of the 2010 TDWG workshop [1], and a =20
> corresponding manuscript on best practices for publishing =20
> phylogenetic trees (Stoltzfus et al. in preparation);
> An 2011 iEvoBio presentation on =93Publishing re-usable phylogenetic =20=

> trees, in theory and in practice=94 [2];
> A lighting talk presentation and Birds-of-a-Feather gathering at =20
> 2011 iEvoBio, and
> A survey group that explored barriers to re-use and developed plans =20=

> for a survey
> These activities have considerably clarified our understanding of =20
> the theory and practice of publishing re-usable phylogenetic trees: =20=

> how many phylogenies are published each year, the (low) frequency of =20=

> archiving, what archives and tools are available, what policies are =20=

> in force, etc.  We have identified a number of barriers to re-use =20
> involving such aspects as technology, standards, culture, and access.
> Many of these barriers can be interpreted as a consequence of the =20
> lack of a community-agreed standard for what constitutes a well =20
> documented phylogenetic record.  In the absence of such a standard, =20=

> trees are often archived as image files rather than in appropriate =20
> data exchange formats, and lack important accompanying information =20
> (metadata), such as externally meaningful identifiers, that would be =20=

> needed to make them useful to others. The idea of a Minimum =20
> Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) standard has been =20=

> suggested [3], but so far there has not been a deliberate process to =20=

> develop and disseminate a community standard.  Meanwhile, a number =20
> of systematics and evolution journals have begun to require =20
> archiving of the data underlying published research findings [4].  =20
> The emerging cultural shift in data archiving and sharing promoted =20
> by this policy change offers a unique window of opportunity to move =20=

> ahead with the development and actual specification of a MIAPA =20
> standard.
> Similar to other minimum reporting standards [5], the primary focus =20=

> of a future MIAPA standard would be on defining a =93checklist=94 of =20=

> metadata information attributes that, at a minimum, needs to =20
> accompany an archived phylogenetic analysis, and to which standards =20=

> values for these attributes would need to adhere. The key step in =20
> developing community consensus on these elements of the standard is =20=

> to convene a series of meetings that collectively involve =20
> participants from all major groups of stakeholders who would be =20

We asked those interested in participating to say "hello" on the MIAPA =20=

list. So far one person did (Son Tran from NMSU).

interpreted as a consequence of the lack of a community-agreed standard =
for what constitutes a well documented phylogenetic record. &nbsp;In the =

there has not been a deliberate process to develop and disseminate a =

evolution journals have begun to require archiving of the data =

>>> Call For Participation:
>>> Steps towards a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA=
) Standard
>>> Synopsis
>>>=20
>>> Many phylogenetic analysis results are published in ways that present se=
rious barriers to their reuse in numerous research applications that would s=
tand to benefit from them. While some of these barriers are well understood,=
 such as issues with adherence to standard exchange formats, those centering=
 on the associated metadata necessary for researchers to evaluate or reuse a=
 published phylogeny have only recently begun to be articulated. One of the c=
ritical next steps towards formalizing these metadata requirements as a mini=
mum reporting standard is to convene meetings of key stakeholder communities=
 with the goal to identify information attributes  necessary and desirable f=
or facilitating reuse, and to build consensus on their priority. To this end=
, we are holding a workshop at the 2011 Biodiversity Information Standards (=
TDWG) Conference to determine how a future reporting standard for phylogenet=
ic analyses can best serve biodiversity science and related research applica=
tions.  We invite all interested colleagues to participate.
>>> Background
>>>=20
>>> The workshop of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Phylogenet=
ics Standards Interest Group held at the 2010 TDWG conference included a pro=
ject focused on how to publish re-usable trees that can be linked into an em=
erging global web of data.  Through follow-up work, this led to the followin=
g tangible results:
>>> An online draft report of the 2010 TDWG workshop [1], and a correspondin=
g manuscript on best practices for publishing phylogenetic trees (Stoltzfus e=
t al. in preparation);
>>> An 2011 iEvoBio presentation on =E2=80=9CPublishing re-usable phylogenet=
ic trees, in theory and in practice=E2=80=9D [2];
>>> A lighting talk presentation and Birds-of-a-Feather gathering at 2011 iE=
voBio, and
>>> A survey group that explored barriers to re-use and developed plans for a=
 survey
>>> These activities have considerably clarified our understanding of the th=
eory and practice of publishing re-usable phylogenetic trees: how many phylo=
genies are published each year, the (low) frequency of archiving, what archi=
ves and tools are available, what policies are in force, etc.  We have ident=
ified a number of barriers to re-use involving such aspects as technology, s=
tandards, culture, and access. =20
>>> Many of these barriers can be interpreted as a consequence of the lack o=
f a community-agreed standard for what constitutes a well documented phyloge=
netic record.  In the absence of such a standard, trees are often archived a=
s image files rather than in appropriate data exchange formats, and lack imp=
ortant accompanying information (metadata), such as externally meaningful id=
entifiers, that would be needed to make them useful to others. The idea of a=
 Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) standard has been=
 suggested [3], but so far there has not been a deliberate process to develo=
p and disseminate a community standard.  Meanwhile, a number of systematics a=
nd evolution journals have begun to require archiving of the data underlying=
 published research findings [4].  The emerging cultural shift in data archi=
ving and sharing promoted by this policy change offers a unique window of op=
portunity to move ahead with the development and actual specification of a M=
IAPA standard.
>>> Similar to other minimum reporting standards [5], the primary focus of a=
 future MIAPA standard would be on defining a =E2=80=9Cchecklist=E2=80=9D of=
 metadata information attributes that, at a minimum, needs to accompany an a=
rchived phylogenetic analysis, and to which standards values for these attri=
butes would need to adhere. The key step in developing community consensus o=
n these elements of the standard is to convene a series of meetings that col=
lectively involve participants from all major groups of stakeholders who wou=
ld be affected by such a standard, such as users, producers, publishers, or a=
rchivists of phylogenetic analyses.  To aid this process, the Phylogenetics S=
tandards Interest Group is holding a workshop at the 2011 TDWG conference, w=
ith the goal to obtain consensus requirements and priorities for a MIAPA che=
cklist for the purposes of biodiversity science, taxonomy, museum collection=
s, and related research applications.
>>> Goals and deliverables
>>>=20
>>> The main goal of the workshop is to develop a shared understanding of th=
e role that a MIAPA standard could play in facilitating re-use of phylogenet=
ic analyses for the biodiversity science and related communities, and what t=
he standard would need to specify in order to  best fill that role. Possible=
 deliverables include
>>> A draft set of information attributes that should or could be included i=
n a provisional MIAPA checklist, with a level of consensus for each of them.=

>>> A database with use-cases based on exemplifying publications, that repor=
t phylogenies to elucidate a broad spectrum of questions relating to biodive=
rsity science.
>>> A refined MIAPA survey to be informed by biodiversity science cases for r=
euse.
>>> A plan for further community engagement and consensus-building among bio=
diversity science stakeholders.
>>> Workshop format
>>>=20
>>> The workshop will start with a few presentations focused on (i) introduc=
ing MIAPA and its potential in facilitating reuse (J. Leebens-Mack); (ii) su=
mmarizing recent developments and current status of MIAPA-related efforts (A=
. Stoltzfus); and (iii) past experiences and resulting best practice recomme=
ndations on developing a minimum reporting checklist standard (D. Field). Th=
e rest of the workshop will be hands-on.  Participants in the workshop will b=
reak out into groups to address separate issues according to the anticipated=
 deliverables and best practice recommendations.
>>> The workshop will be 1.5 days in duration, and be held during the 2011 B=
iodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) conference, to take place Oct 17 to=
 21, 2011 in New Orleans, USA. (http://www.tdwg.org/conference2011/).  The w=
orkshop will start in the afternoon of Monday, Oct 17, and end on Tuesday. O=
ct 18.
>>> How to participate
>>>=20
>>> Participation in the workshop is open to everyone interested. However, s=
pace is limited, and we therefore ask that, if you are interested in attendi=
ng, to please communicate your interest through the MIAPA discussion group [=
6]. This will also allow us to include you in pre-workshop planning. Since t=
he workshop is part of the TDWG conference, participants will need to regist=
er either for the full conference, or for the days of the workshop. =20

an>Similar to other minimum reporting standards [5], the primary focus of a f=
uture MIAPA standard would be on defining a =E2=80=9Cchecklist=E2=80=9D of m=
etadata information attributes that, at a minimum, needs to accompany an arc=
hived phylogenetic analysis, and to which standards values for these attribu=
tes would need to adhere. The key step in developing community consensus on t=
hese elements of the standard is to convene a series of meetings that collec=
tively involve participants from all major groups of stakeholders who would b=
e affected by such a standard, such as users, producers, publishers, or arch=
ivists of phylogenetic analyses. &nbsp;To aid this process, the Phylogenetic=
s Standards Interest Group is holding a workshop at the 2011 TDWG conference=
, with the goal to obtain consensus requirements and priorities for a MIAPA c=
hecklist for the purposes of biodiversity science, taxonomy, museum collecti=
ons, and related research applications.</span></div><h3 class=3D"c1" style=3D=

Hello all,

I won't be at the TDWG meeting, but I will be at the Genome Standards Conso=
rtium meeting next week in Bremen (http://gensc.org/gc_wiki/index.php/GSC_1=
2).  Will anyone else from these lists be in attendance, and in particular =
does anyone already plan to represent/present an update on MIAPA?  If not, =
I'd be happy to do so, with some help from those closer to the action.

>>> The workshop of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Phylogene=
tics Standards Interest Group held at the 2010 TDWG conference included a p=
roject focused on how to publish re-usable trees that can be linked into an=
 emerging global web of data.  Through follow-up work, this led to the foll=
owing tangible results:

heory and practice of publishing re-usable phylogenetic trees: how many phy=
logenies are published each year, the (low) frequency of archiving, what ar=
chives and tools are available, what policies are in force, etc.  We have i=
dentified a number of barriers to re-use involving such aspects as technolo=
gy, standards, culture, and access. =20
>>> Many of these barriers can be interpreted as a consequence of the lack =
of a community-agreed standard for what constitutes a well documented phylo=
genetic record.  In the absence of such a standard, trees are often archive=
d as image files rather than in appropriate data exchange formats, and lack=
 important accompanying information (metadata), such as externally meaningf=
ul identifiers, that would be needed to make them useful to others. The ide=
a of a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) standard h=
as been suggested [3], but so far there has not been a deliberate process t=
o develop and disseminate a community standard.  Meanwhile, a number of sys=
tematics and evolution journals have begun to require archiving of the data=
 underlying published research findings [4].  The emerging cultural shift i=
n data archiving and sharing promoted by this policy change offers a unique=
 window of opportunity to move ahead with the development and actual specif=
ication of a MIAPA standard.
>>> Similar to other minimum reporting standards [5], the primary focus of =
a future MIAPA standard would be on defining a =93checklist=94 of metadata =
information attributes that, at a minimum, needs to accompany an archived p=
hylogenetic analysis, and to which standards values for these attributes wo=
uld need to adhere. The key step in developing community consensus on these=
 elements of the standard is to convene a series of meetings that collectiv=
ely involve participants from all major groups of stakeholders who would be=
 affected by such a standard, such as users, producers, publishers, or arch=
ivists of phylogenetic analyses.  To aid this process, the Phylogenetics St=
andards Interest Group is holding a workshop at the 2011 TDWG conference, w=
ith the goal to obtain consensus requirements and priorities for a MIAPA ch=
ecklist for the purposes of biodiversity science, taxonomy, museum collecti=

in ways that present serious barriers to their reuse in numerous research a=

hers to evaluate or reuse a published phylogeny have only recently begun to=
 be articulated. One of the critical next steps towards formalizing these m=
etadata requirements as a minimum reporting standard is to convene meetings=
 of key stakeholder communities with the goal to identify information attri=

nsus on their priority. To this end, we are holding a workshop at the 2011 =
Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Conference to determine how a fut=

n>Many of these barriers can be interpreted as a consequence of the lack of=
 a community-agreed standard for what constitutes a well documented phyloge=
netic record. =A0In the absence of such a standard, trees are often archive=
d as image files rather than in appropriate data exchange formats, and lack=
 important accompanying information (metadata), such as externally meaningf=

a of a=A0</span><span style=3D"font-style:italic">Minimum Information About=

 [3], but so far there has not been a deliberate process to develop and dis=

iEvoBio, the conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, =20
and Biodiversity, is a recently founded satellite conference held in =20
conjunction with the Evolution meetings. iEvoBio aims to be a forum =20
bringing together biologists working in evolution, systematics, and =20
biodiversity, with software developers, and mathematicians, both to =20
catalyse the development of new tools, and to increase awareness of =20
the possibilities offered by existing technologies (ranging from mega-=20=

scale data analysis to rich visualization). The inaugural meeting was =20=

held in 2010 (see http://ievobio.org/2010) and received wide acclaim; =20=

the second one, held in 2011 (see http://ievobio.org/2011), was =20
similarly successful and productive. The conference is poised to =20
establish itself as a self-sustaining annual event and a must-attend =20
for researchers, developers, and users of informatics resources in our =20=

fields.

For the 2012 iEvoBio conference, to be held in junction with the 2012 =20=

Evolution Meetings in Ottawa, Canada, we are seeking new members to =20
join us on the organizing committee. Aside from being enthusiastic =20
about the conference itself, we are particularly interested in people =20=

with research pursuits that involve integrative, interdisciplinary, =20
and synthetic questions, and a commitment to promoting the reuse of =20
data, information, and software.

Serving on the iEvoBio organizing committee entails attending weekly =20
conference calls, and sharing responsibility for making the conference =20=

happen at all stages, including crafting communications such as calls =20=

for abstracts, managing content contributions from participants, and =20
budgeting.

The iEvoBio organizing committee shapes and manages the entire event, =20=

from start to finish.  As such, participating in the committee =20
provides ample opportunities for people with ideas, wild or not, to =20
conceive innovative program elements towards iEvoBio=92s social =20
objectives of fostering participation, interaction, and collaboration, =20=

and to make those happen. The committee has been marked by an open-=20
minded, highly constructive, but also deeply professional climate. =20
Serving on the committee is actual work, but also provides a unique =20
opportunity to collaborate with like-minded people who one may not =20
otherwise get to work with, on a product for the benefit of our =20
community and the advancement of our science.

To apply, fill out a short online application form at =
http://bit.ly/okxqS1=20
  by October 15th, 2011.  We expect the organizing committee to have =20
at least 6-7 members, and thus currently at least 4-5 seats are =20
available to be filled through this call.  This call is open to people =20=

at all professional =93grades=94 and our hope is that at least one, and =20=

hopefully more, seats will be filled with graduate or postdoctoral =20
students.  We (see the undersigned below) will sort through the =20
applications and reach a decision within one week after close of =20
applications. If you have any questions about the conference or the =20
committee, we encourage you to resolve these before applying by =20
contacting us (see email addresses below).

Please feel free to re-send, tweet (http://bit.ly/qyYT0s), or share =20
this message as needed. Thanks!

On behalf of the future 2012 iEvoBio Organizing Committee,

Dear workshop participants and others--

At the TDWG (Biodiversity Info Standards) meeting next week in New  
Orleans, there will be a workshop on phylogenetic standards.  The  
workshop page, with the schedule, is here:

  http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/MIAPAWorkshop2011

Like last year, this will be a quasi-OpenSpace meeting.  The workshop  
opens Monday with 3 short talks to set the stage.  Then participants  
are invited to discuss issues arising from the talks, and then to  
discuss possible projects.  Monday will end with participants  
coalescing spontaneously into clusters (of about 3 to 7 people each)  
to work on a project they have designed.  Tuesday is the work day--  
clusters will work all day on projects, taking breaks as needed.

While this may not sound like much time, a cluster with clear goals  
can accomplish a lot in one day.  One of the projects from last year  
turned into a larger study (manuscript in preparation) that you will  
hear about in my talk on Monday.

I'm going to send a separate message about project ideas.

Dear workshop participants and others--

Now is the time to start thinking about possible workshop projects, if  
you haven't done so already.  You do NOT have to be a workshop  
participant to help in the process of developing and discussing ideas.

Please consider adding an idea on the "ideas" page here (you just need  
to get a TDWG twiki account):

   http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/MIAPAWorkshop2011Ideas

The two ideas listed currently are:

  * Create benchmark of annotated pubs relating phylogenies and  
biodiversity
  * Sharing the tree of life: What can we learn from the re-use (and  
lack of re-use) of mega-phylogenies?

I have cc'ed this message to the tdwg-phylo list and to some  
individuals who indicated their intention to participate.  However,  
please address your replies only to the miapa-discuss list.  Those who  
want to join in discussion will need to join the list.

On behalf of the workshop organizers (Jim Leebens-Mack, Hilmar Lapp,  
Nico Cellinese, Enrico Pontelli),

Every year, the number and size of available species phylogenies grows, =
with the largest trees now exceeding 10^5 tips.   The information =
contained in these megatrees is tremendous, but there is no easy way to =
access and use it.  =20

To address this issue, a NESCent working group, named HIP (Hackathons, =
Interoperability, Phylogenies), has planned a hackathon =
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) in which scientist-programmers =
will design and implement Phylotastic!, an open software system to =
extract a  phylogeny for a named set of species from available =
megatrees, and optionally create mash-ups with data from online =
services.   Phylotastic is envisioned as a set of web services  that =
collectively provides the operations - pruning, grafting, =
name-reconciliation, branch estimation, translation - that will =
democratize using the Tree of Life, making it accessible and computable =
for researchers throughout the life sciences, from community ecology to =
comparative genomics

Applications are now being accepted to participate in the Phylotastic =
hackathon, which will take place June 4 to 8 at NESCent headquarters in =
Durham, NC (see below, How to Apply).   Support for travel and meal =
expenses will be available to each successful applicant, according to =
his or her stated needs. =20

We urge you to apply if you are enthusiastic about the goals of the =
project, and you have one or more of the following skills:
  o development, adaptation and use of software for megatree =
informatics,
  o grafting & pruning trees,
  o branch length estimation,
  o NeXML support,
  o provenance annotation,
  o mashups (semantic integration),
  o taxonomic name resolution,
  o phylogenetic visualization,
  o construction of and programming with web service interfaces, and
  o assembling web-services into executable workflows .=20

We also welcome your application if you can envision a role for yourself =
based on other attributes not listed, including non-programming skills =
(e.g.,  generating documentation) and expert knowledge of use-cases =
(i.e., real-world problems). =20

To understand how you might be able to contribute, please review a brief =
slide presentation (ppt format, http://bit.ly/xGvwRr, or PDF format, =
http://bit.ly/wcQzMI).  If further information is needed, consult the =
Phylotastic project wiki (http://www.evoio.org/wiki/Phylotastic), or =
contact a member of the HIP leadership team (listed below).  =20

Sincerely,

Hilmar Lapp(*)

2. SCOPING STATEMENTS

To further clarify the project, consider the following points.

In scope:
  o Populating data store of existing trees
  o Evolution of PhyloWS to support the needs of PhyloTastic
  o Taxonomic name resolution (embedding existing TNRS capacities)
  o Pruning trees and grafting species on them
  o Branch length (existing methods for incorporating branch lengths)
  o Integration of data and trees (e.g., mashups) - species-wise =
integration
  o Display of resulting trees (using existing technologies)
  o Wrap all these existing tools as web services
  o NeXML syntax extensions if needed
  o If needed, determine methods for compressing NeXML representations
  o user interfaces that are simple (web form) or that adapt existing =
tools

Not In Scope:
  o Constructing new input trees
  o New Data Generation
  o Arguing or evaluating the correctness of trees
  o Design of new TNRS systems
  o Debates about which naming system is best
  o Developing new techniques to derive branch lengths

Uncertain:
  o Phylo-referencing
  o Satisfying  any particular standard of provenance annotation

3. HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenetics)

The Phylotastic Hackathon represents the first of three sponsored by a =
new working group at NESCent called HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, =
Phylogenetics).   HIP is organized by a Leadership Team consisting of  =
Karen Cranston, Sergei Kosakovsky Pond, Hilmar Lapp, Enrico Pontelli =
(PI), Michael Rosenberg, Brian Sidlauskas, Arlin Stoltzfus (PI), Rutger =
Vos (PI), Mark Westneat, and Mark Wilkinson.=20

More information about HIP, including goals, strategies, and project =
ideas, can be found here:   http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP

The Call for Abstracts for full talks is now open for the 2012 =
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity =
(iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012. See below =
for instructions.=20

Accepted talks will be 15 minutes in length and will be presented during =
the full talk session of the conference.  Because the number of program =
slots for full talks is limited, some talks may be moved to the =
Lightning Talk session (5 minutes in length).

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at advancing =
research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, including new =
tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data analysis, and =
visualization.=20

Submissions should be 1 page long at most and include a title, a list of =
contributors, and an abstract. The abstract should provide an overview =
of the talk's subject, and give enough detail to allow reviewers to =
decide whether the submission merits a full talk, or whether it should =
be moved to a Lightning Talk session.  If the subject of the talk is a =
specific software component for use by the research community, the =
abstract must state the license and give the URL where the source code =
is available so reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) =
is met.

The deadline for submission is April 2, 2012. We intend to notify =
authors of accepted talks before early registration for iEvoBio (and =
Evolution) ends. Further instructions for submission are at the =
following URL:
http://ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012/schedConf/cfp

Full talks are one of the five kinds of contributed content that feature =
in iEvoBio. The other four are: 1) Lightning talks (5 mins long), 2) =
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) =
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries is already =
open (see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html). The calls for contribution =
to the other three sessions will open later, and will remain open until =
shortly before the conference or until the respective track fills up. In =
addition, 2012 iEvoBio sponsor Biomatters Ltd will be running the =
Geneious Challenge alongside this year=92s iEvoBio Challenge, see =
http://ievobio.org/geneious_challenge.html for more information.

More details about the conference and program are available at =
http://ievobio.org. You can also find continuous updates on the =
conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio and Google+ =
page, or subscribe to the low-traffic iEvoBio announcements mailing list =
at http://groups.google.com/group/ievobio-announce.

iEvoBio 2012 is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis =
Center (NESCent) and by Biomatters Ltd., in partnership with the Society =
for the Study of Evolution (SSE) and the Systematic Biologists (SSB).

(*) iEvoBio and its sponsors are dedicated to promoting the practice and =
philosophy of Open Source software development (see =
http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) and reuse within the =
research community. For this reason, if a submitted talk concerns a =
specific software system for use by the research community, that =
software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License (see =
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be available for download, =
including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or =
through a widely used version control system like cvs, Subversion, git, =
Bazaar, or Mercurial.  Authors of full talks who cannot meet this =
requirement at the time of submission should state their intentions, and =
are advised that the requirement must be met by July 9, 2012, at the =
latest.=

The Call for Lightning Talks is now open for the 2012 conference on =
Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at =
http://ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012. See below for =
instructions.

Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes. They are ideal for =
drawing the attention of the audience to new developments, tools, and =
resources, or to subsequent events where more in-depth information can =
be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more information =
(http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning). Lightning talks will be part of =
the more interactive program elements on both conference days.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at advancing =
research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, including new =
tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data analysis, and =
visualization.

Submissions should be 1 page long at most and include a title, a list of =
contributors, and an abstract. The abstract should provide an overview =
of the talk's subject.  Reviewers will judge whether a submission is =
within scope of the conference (see above). If applicable, the abstract =
must also state the license and give the URL where the source code is =
available so reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is =
met.

Review and acceptance of lightning talks will be on a rolling basis.  =
The deadline for submission is the morning of the first day of the =
conference (July 10), but see below. Further instructions for submission =
are at the following URL:
http://ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012/schedConf/cfp

Please make sure to choose the Lightning Talks track for your =
submission. Note that the number of lightning talk slots is finite and =
that therefore the track may fill up early. We cannot accept lightning =
talks until the open-source requirements are met, and so waiting with =
that until the deadline risks that the track is full by that time.=20

We ask all submitters of lightning talks to be willing to also serve as =
reviewers of such, as described above.

Lightning talks are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that =
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (open until April =
2), 2) Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) =
Birds-of- a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries remains =
open (see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html). The calls for contribution =
to the other two sessions will open later, and will remain open until =
shortly before the conference or until the respective track fills up. In =
addition, 2012 iEvoBio sponsor Biomatters Ltd will be running the =
Geneious Challenge alongside this year=92s iEvoBio Challenge, see =
http://ievobio.org/geneious_challenge.html for more information.

Many trees enter.=20
Fresh analysis ensues.
New insights emerge.

The conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and =
Biodiversity (iEvoBio) is again holding a Challenge competition in 2012, =
on the theme "Synthesizing Phylogenies". Somewhere, buried in large sets =
of trees, lies a stunning new revelation, a baffling discovery, the =
answer to a longstanding controversy, or simply something not obvious to =
the naked eye.  The mission of the 2012 iEvoBio challenge is to find =
those revelations, discoveries and answers within your own data and/or =
within one of the datasets provided by the challenge.  What new =
scientifically interesting results can you pull from these trees, using =
any combination of techniques at your disposal?

Further information on the nature of challenge entries and how to submit =
them can be found on the iEvoBio website at =
http://ievobio.org/challenge.html. Submissions are due by June 25, 2012. =
Selected candidates will make short oral presentations to demonstrate =
their work in a "Challenge session" at the conference, and if suitable =
will automatically be entered into the Software Bazaar track of the =
conference.=20

Cash prizes will be awarded for first place (USD 1,500) and runner-up =
entries. The winning entries will be selected by a vote of the iEvoBio =
meeting participants.

Alongside the iEvoBio Challenge, 2012 iEvoBio sponsor Biomatters Ltd is =
running the Geneious Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to develop =
a new plugin to Geneious Pro, using the public API, that enables a new =
and exciting visualization or analysis. The winning entry will receive a =
$1000 cash prize, and all entrants who submit by the deadline will =
receive a 12-month subscription license. The Geneious Challenge has the =
same open and closing dates as the iEvoBio Challenge. See =
http://ievobio.org/geneious_challenge.html for more information.=20

Separate from iEvoBio, the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) is leading a =
Phylogenetic Tree challenge to encourage not only the development of =
large phylogenies, but their practical use. Together with the Global =
Names project they will choose two winning entries: one for the best =
large tree and one for the most promising but not necessarily large tree =
-- both in Darwin Core Archive format suitable for use in major =
biodiversity websites such as EOL. The two winners will receive paid =
trips to the 2012 iEvoBio conference. See =
http://eol.org/info/tree_challenge for more information.

More details about the iEvoBio conference and program are available at =
http://ievobio.org. You can also find continuous updates on the =
conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio and Google+ =
page, or subscribe to the low-traffic iEvoBio announcements mailing list =

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2012

http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2012

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a mentoring
organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm)
(http://code.google.com/soc/ ).

Students in the program receive a stipend from Google (and the coveted
T-shirt upon completion!), and work from their home, or home
institution, for the duration of the 3 month program. You will have the
opportunity to collaborate with our enthusiastic mentor community, and
will have at least one dedicated mentor to help you complete your
project.

We are particularly targeting students interested in both evolutionary
biology and software development. Our website, above, lists potential
projects. Projects include many programming languages (e.g. C/C++,
Java, Perl, R) and cover subjects ranging from visualization to
algorithm implementation to data interoperability. You don't need to
be an expert in either evolutionary biology or software development -
find a project idea that interests you, and we can work with you to
develop a proposal that fits your skills. We also welcome novel
project ideas apart from those already on the list.

INTERESTED? Contact us phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly
encourage all interested students to get in touch with us with their
ideas as early on as possible. Admission is competitive, and we want
plenty of time to work with you to develop a great project proposal.

TO APPLY: Apply online at the Google Summer of Code website:

http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012

where you will also find GSoC program rules and eligibility
requirements.  The 14-day application period for students opens on
Monday March 26th and runs through Friday, April 6th, 2012.

The Call for Software Bazaar entries is now open for the 2012 conference =
on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), =
at http://ievobio.org/ocs2/index.php/ievobio/2012. See below for =
instructions.=20

The Software Bazaar features presenters demonstrating their software =
live on a laptop. At iEvoBio, this session takes the place of a poster =
session, and will be approximately 2.0 hours in duration. Conference =
attendees will be able to walk from one demonstration to the next and =
talk with the presenters.  Please also see our FAQ =
(http://ievobio.org/faq.html).

Entries should be software aimed at advancing research in phylogenetics, =
evolution, and biodiversity, and can include interactive visualizations =
that have been pre-computed (such as SVGs, or Google Earth-compatible =
KML files). Note that commercial marketing activities are not permitted =
- presenters wishing to promote commercial or proprietary services or =
products should contact the Evolution conference about exhibitor space =
(http://www.confersense.ca/Evolution2012).

Submissions consist of a title, which will typically be the name of the =
software (or visualization method) being presented, the URL of a website =
where more information can be obtained, and the license under which the =
source code is available. The website must contain a link to where the =
source code (and possibly binaries) can be downloaded. If it is not =
obvious from the website, the submission must describe what the software =
does. Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the =
conference (see above), and need to be able to verify whether the =
open-source requirement(*) is met.

Presenters are expected to bring their own laptops for presentation, and =
any auxiliary devices necessary (such as a mouse). Power will be =
available at the presentation tables (110V/60Hz, US-style plugs; =
international presenters need to bring a suitable adaptor). Please let =
the organizing committee know as much in advance as possible if you =
expect to have unusually high demands for wireless network bandwidth, a =
large display, or other hardware.

Review and acceptance of Software Bazaar submissions will be on a =
rolling basis. The deadline for submission is the morning of the first =
day of the conference (July 10), but, because space for Software Bazaar =
presentations is finite, we cannot guarantee the availability of slots =
for late submissions. We cannot accept submissions until the open-source =
requirements are met.

Software Bazaar demonstrations are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed =
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks =
(closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3) Challenge entries, and 4) =
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. The Calls for Challenge entries =
(http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) and Lightning Talks (same submission =
URL as above) remain open, and the Birds-of-a-Feather call is =
forthcoming.

More details about the conference and program are available at =
http://ievobio.org. You can also find continuous updates on the =
conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio and Google+ =
page, or subscribe to the low-traffic iEvoBio announcements mailing list =
at http://groups.google.com/group/ievobio-announce.

iEvoBio 2012 is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis =
Center (NESCent) and by Biomatters Ltd., in partnership with the Society =
for the Study of Evolution (SSE) and the Systematic Biologists (SSB).

(*) iEvoBio and its sponsors are dedicated to promoting the practice and =
philosophy of Open Source software development (see =
http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) and reuse within the =
research community. For this reason, software to be demonstrated to =
conference attendees must be licensed with a recognized Open Source =
License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be available for =
download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through =
ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs, =
Subversion, git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.  Authors are advised that =
non-compliant submissions must be revised to meet the requirement by =
July 8 at the latest, and in the event that presentation slots run out, =
precedence is established by the date they are first found in =
compliance, not the date of submission.=

As some of you might have noticed in the workshop program for the 2013 =
TDWG Conference that just went online, the Phylogenetics Standards IG =
will be holding a half-day symposium/workshop combination there.

The title of the event is "Sharing and delivery of reusable phylogenetic =
knowledge". There's now an initial website for the event on our wiki:

=
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/PhyloSharingWorkshop2013=


If you have any feedback, ideas (including for symposium speakers(*)), =
or other input for the workshop, please don't hesitate to let us know.

	-Hilmar, Nico, & Rutger

(*) At Nico's behest, all speakers must agree to give their talks in =
Italian ;)

If you haven't been aware yet, the Phylogenetics IG at TDWG, together =
with Rutger Vos (NCB Naturalis Museum, Leiden), will be holding a =
combined symposium and workshop with the title "Sharing and delivery of =
reusable phylogenetic knowledge".

The event aims to present and put to the test recent community progress =
towards effective sharing and reuse of expert phylogenetic knowledge, a =
key ingredient to addressing comparative research questions across =
biology. Even though many researchers would rather reuse a quality =
phylogeny than try to build it themselves, in practice it is difficult =
and often enough impossible to find suitable phylogenies, to evaluate =
their fitness for purpose, and to access them in a format suitable for =
analysis. To mitigate these obstacles, an interdisciplinary grassroots =
network has begun to develop solutions that include data standards, =
metadata ontologies, a decoupled architecture, and community-building =
hackathons. Aside from presenting the results of these efforts and =
showcasing diverse applications for phylogeny reuse, the event will =
allow participants to inform these efforts so they respond to =
biodiversity science needs. Finally, the event is designed to catalyze =
new collaborations by providing ample room for interactive =
demonstrations using participant-contributed research problems.

The event will take place in the morning of Thursday, Oct 31.

Speakers:

* Ross Mounce, University of Bath, UK: Sharing phylogenetic data: even =
more vital for morphological data
* Jonathan Rees, National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), USA: =
Assembling a draft overall tree of life from phylogenetic trees and =
taxonomic databases
* Rutger Vos, NCB Museum Naturalis, Netherlands: PhyloTastic - =
names-based phyloinformatic data integration
* Saverio Vicario, Institute for Biomedical Technologies, Italy: =
Numerical tree representations and their application to MCMC =
phylogenetic inference, phylogenetic signal, and ... database query
* Alexandre Antonelli, University of Gothenburg, Sweden: SUPERSMART: =
Self-Updating Platform for Estimating Rates of Speciation and Migration, =
Ages and Relationships of Taxa
* Suzanna Lewis, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA: Quest for =
Orthologs: anchoring comparative biology research

Full details are on our IG wiki:

We hope to see as many of you there as possible.
