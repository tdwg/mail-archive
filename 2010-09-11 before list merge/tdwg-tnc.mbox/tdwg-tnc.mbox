Dear All

=20

A new task group is being set up under TNS to report on TCS usability. A
draft Charter for the group is now available on the TNC wiki
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TNC/WebHome=20

direct link
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TNC/TCSUsageTaskGroupCharter=20

=20

We would like to get the charter off to the TDWG exec for approval so
that the task group can get on with things...

=20

Please have a look and contribute if you have views.=20

If you want to be a member please contact Aaron.

Dear TDWG TNC Member,

We plan to hold a group discussion about the "Species Profile Model" SPM
(previously known as "Taxon Data Model") at the TDWG 2007 conference,
possibly on Sunday 16th during the group meetings slot (09.00-17.00). We =
are
trying to gauge interest and potential numbers and to avoid clashes with
other parallel discussions that might be taking place.

The SPM is intended to describe species facts (organised into =
categories) as
might appear in "species bank" type web applications like Encyclopedia =
of
Life or FishBase/SeaLifePortal.

We do not intend to duplicate the work of TCS and SDD for nomenclature =
and
taxonomy but rather draw on them, and other TDWG standards, wherever
appropriate. We want it to fit in with the TDWG technical architecture =
and
will work closely with all concerned to do this.  It seemed to us that =
the
SPM was sufficiently distinct to warrant set up a new group within TDWG =
with
cross linkages to other groups where appropriate. =20

For a background, see the wiki here: =
http://wiki.tdwg.org/TaxonDataModel,
and the summary of a recent workshop held at GBIF here:
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TaxonDataModel/SpeciesModelWorkshopRe=
por
t.=20

You can subscribe to the taxon-data-model mailing list here to follow
developments and contribute:
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/taxon-data-model (mailing list
information web page) taxon-data-model@lists.tdwg.org
<mailto:taxon-data-model@lists.tdwg.org> (mailing list web address)

Please reply to me directly to let me know if you are interested in
attending the SPM workgroup during the TDWG conference. At this stage it =
is
purely to get a rough indication of numbers so there is no real =
commitment
required on your part.

Best regards,

=C9amonn

Eamonn,

With hats on a TAG convener and TNC participant I would be keen for =20
this meeting not to overlap with any TAG meeting scheduled for that day.

If they SPM is going to interoperate with SDD and TNS/TCS then it =20
needs the TAG to get the mechanisms right.

The TAG meeting is currently scheduled between 14:00 and 17:00. We =20
could squeeze a little but I don't want to go below 2 hours or it =20
will be impossible to get anything achieved.

All the best,

Roger

Roger,

So it looks like Sunday is not an option - there is also the related =
GISIN
invasive species group meeting that preceeds the TAG meeting.  I just
received a few responses and have to assume that the core people who
attended the Species Model Workshop in GBIF will be interested in =
attending
an SPM meeting. The only other option is to revert to the original Tues
afternoon 16.00-18.00 slot - sharing it with SDD. We could maybe have an
hour each and then join up for joint discussions.

Best regards,

=C9amonn

Eamonn,

It may be that this is a good solution as clearing up the overlaps =20
with SPM/SDD is an important thing to do.

Gregor may have an opinion on this though.

Hi,
I am currently experiencing some problems with implementing TCS 1.01

There are a couple of elements that do not have a simple element, like =
Genus (type=3DReferenceType) or Rank (type=3DTaxonomicRank),
therefore you don't expect a value for these elements, although it is =
not invalid and the documentation suggests that there is a value. If =
there is a value, you don't know if it is a string or something else.

Based on the schema you would expect=20
<Genus ref=3D"ref1" linkType=3D"local" />

but in an instance doc you will probably get:

<Genus ref=3D"ref1" linkType=3D"local" />Xyz</Genus> or even =
<Genus>Xyz</Genus>

Applications that generate sample docs based on the schema, like oXygen, =
or parse the schema, like Pywrapper Schema Parser will not treat the =
element as having a value.

This is probably also the cause that aliases for these elements are =
missing in the TAPIR Concept Name server at TDWG: =
http://rs.tdwg.org/tapir/cns/alias.txt

Regards,

Wouter Addink

Hi all,

I'm new to this list and hope that the following are appropriate questions. 
In Bratislava, I wasn't keeping detailed enough notes on projects and their 
current and future plans wrt TCS.

What sites are currently publishing TCS-formatted data or will be within 
the year? I know that zoobank.org will be publishing TCS data in the near 
future. Is GBIF? ITIS? Species2000?

What sites are publishing real "taxon concept" data (in TCS format or not)? 
Conversely, what sites are simply publishing "nominal taxon concepts" as 
opposed to detailed authoritative taxon concepts?

Is this the kind of thing for which we should generate a survey to send to 
sites (i.e. their plans for publishing TCS) or distrubute to TDWG members?

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Paul and others,

This leads me to a couple of questions about serving TCS data.  For example,
strictly speaking, ZooBank will be return metadata in accordance with the
"TaxonNameLsidVoc"
(http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/TaxonNameLsidVoc), which is based
on TCS, but is not TCS per se (ZooBank is concerned with taxon names, not
concepts). There is also the TaxonConceptLsidVoc
(http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TAG/TaxonConceptLsidVoc), which
together with the TaxonNameLsidVoc and other more genral ontologies,
collectively represent the same information as a TCS XML document.  I guess
that one of the things I'm not clear on is whether RDF returned for an LSID
counts as "TCS", or does TCS specifically mean a document structured
according to the TCS XML Schema?

Also, what are we really serving when we say we're serving TCS documents?
Name-only data is part of TCS, but I wouldn't think of it as TCS per se.  I
think you need it in the cntext of an "accordingTo" instance.  (By the way
-- Roger -- I'd always thought of "accordingTo" as referring to a
PublicationCitation, not an Actor or Team.  A topic of discussion for
another day...

But my point is, I've got hundreds of thousands of database records for
[Name accordingTo Publication], which each represent a pointer to a taxon
concept (that is, "concept" sensu Kennedy, not sensu Pyle).  And for many of
these, I also have information on synonymies within the Publication (i.e.,
taxon concepts defined at the resolution of names, which means at the
implied resolution of type specimens).  What I don't have, however, is
robust sets of "taxon concept" records that go into more specific detail
regarding the definition of the concept itself (in terms of non-type
specimens and/or character data, for example).  Also, I don't have much in
the way of third-party RelationshipAssertions to define how these alternate
concepts map to each other.

This leads to the question I've been meaning to ask, which is "How much
information do I need before I call it a TCS document?"  I would say raw
names data alone don't cut it -- you would need at least an "accordingTo"
before you could call it a concept/TCS document.  But if all I have as an
accordingTo (with no additional specimens or characters or
RelationshipAssertions), do I still call it TCS?

Sorry if I'm over-thinking this...

Aloha,
Rich

Hi Paul

IPNI is also serving TCS data either through LSID resolution or you 
can drill down into an individual record to get TCS. By the nature of 
IPNI, these are original concepts only.

Someone circulated a survey a year or two back about who was 
using taxon concepts & to what extent but I can't remember who it 
was or whether the results were ever published - someone else 
may remember!

HTH

Sally

Paul, Rich et al.

I'll try and answer all the questions in a single mail and also keep  
it short.

Taxon Concept Schema (TCS) is an XML Schema that was standardized by  
TDWG in 2005 but TCS also uses as short hand for distinguishing  
between Taxon Names and Taxon Concepts.

The fundamental thing that TCS does (both the schema and the way of  
modeling) is separate TaxonNames (or nomenclatural acts) from  
TaxonConcepts (actual delimited or implied taxa that one would  
identify something to).

In order to issue LSIDs for TaxonNames or TaxonConcepts it is  
necessary to represent them in RDF rather than XML Schema. RDF is far  
more modular by nature than XML Schema and so two vocabularies were  
put together to represent TaxonNames and TaxonConcepts (rather than  
one schema) but unless you are issuing pure nomenclatural data you  
will usually use both.

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept

The TaxonName vocabulary is being used by IPNI, Index Fungorum and  
soon ZooBank. It is also being used by GBIF and anyone else who uses  
the TaxonConcept or TaxonOccurrence because it is embedded within  
these vocabularies. In fact it could be used anywhere some one wants  
to break apart a name string.

The TaxonOccurrence vocabulary is being issued by the CATE project  
(don't have the reference to hand) and Species2k/Catalogue of life  
are going to use it for their checklist and of course by others who  
issue TaxonOccurrence data.

I'll show and example of the embedding as it makes things clearer.  
This is abbreviated for clarity. Suppose we want to express an  
occurrence of a taxon (perhaps as a specimen)

<to:TaxonOccurrence rdf:about="urn:lsid:example.com:specimens:1234">
	<dc:title>Hyam.R.D. 284927 - Rhododendron ponticum L.</dc:title>
	<to:collector>Roger Hyam</to:collector>
	<.... other stuff ...>
	<to:identifiedTo>
		<to:Identification>
			<to:expertName>Chris Browning</to:expertName>
			<to:taxonName>Rhododendron ponticum L.</to:taxonName>
			<to:taxon >
				<tc:TaxonConcept>
					<tc:hasName>
						<tn:TaxonName>
							<tn:genusPart>Rhododendron</tn:genusPart>
							<tn:specificEpithet>ponticum</tn:specificEpithet >
							<tn:authorship>L.</tn:authorship >
						<tn:TaxonName>
					</tc:hasName>
					<tc:accordingToString>Brown and Smith 1995</tc:accordingToString>
					<tcom:publishedIn>Some monograph by some guys</tcom:publishedIn>
					<tcom:microReference>page 32</tcom:microReference>
					<tcom:publishedInCitation rdf:reference="http:// 
some.uri.to.some.citation.for.the.pub"/>
				</tc:TaxonConcept>
			</to:taxon>
		</to:Identification>	
	</to:identifiedTo>
</to:TaxonOccurrence>

So we have a TaxonOccurrence (really like a DarwinCore record but  
with embedding). In order to express the identification of this  
specimen in more detail than just a string we include a TaxonConcept  
and a TaxonName. Neither the concept nor the name have identities  
(they are both anonymous) but they are both objects of that type.  
They could be replaced by references to external instances. There are  
also properties to allow the supplier to "cop-out" of embedding  
referencing anything and simply include a string if that is all they  
have in their database.

So in issuing a TaxonOccurrence record I use both TaxonConcept and  
TaxonName vocabularies. I am not using TCS in the sense of the XML  
Schema but I am using in the sense of the notions involved.

This is where we are  headed with integrated standards and semantic  
approaches.

I hope this helps.

BTW I hope it answers Rich's question as it is possible to add  
reference info in the TaxonConcept to say where it was published  
using the common properties defined in:

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Common

All the best,

Roger

Dear All,
         I thought I would chip in and say that the two CATE websites are
resolving LSIDs for taxon concepts, and returning metadata typed according
to http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept. Their urls are
http://www.cate-araceae.org which is a web-revision of the Araceae (Arums
and relatives) and http://www.cate-sphingidae.org which is a web-revision of
the Sphingidae (Hawkmoths). In each case, we're returing the concept sensu
the web-revision, rather than a paper publication, which means that it is
the name as used by the editorial boards of the websites and published on
the pages of the website. It is the intention to extend this group through
the addition of an open peer-review process (see
http://www.cate-project.org).

At the moment, we're only returning taxon concepts, name strings, a link to
the taxon page on the website, and taxonomic relationships to other taxon
concepts (child taxa and synonyms). The Araceae site also returns IPNI lsids
where we've been able to match the name to a name in IPNI. We'd like to do
the same for the sphingids if an authority for sphingid names becomes
available. We've got lots of descriptive information as well, and I expect
that we'll use the SPM to make that available eventually.

Cheers,
       Ben

Hi Roger,

I'd like you to comment on the issue of validation. In RDF, with its =
Open
World assumption, we loose the ability to validate. So how easy is it to
take RDF output and, if an application requires it, re-format it so that =
it
can be validated against an XML Schema, i.e., take your example below =
and
link it to an XML Schema. I understand that there are multiple ways in =
RDF
to express the same thing, so would that create problems for a schema if =
the
RDF was coming from different data providers. Or do we have control of =
that
because of the LSID vocabularies?

Subject: Re: [tdwg-tnc] LSIDs and taxon concepts


Paul, Rich et al.

I'll try and answer all the questions in a single mail and also keep =20
it short.

Taxon Concept Schema (TCS) is an XML Schema that was standardized by =20
TDWG in 2005 but TCS also uses as short hand for distinguishing =20
between Taxon Names and Taxon Concepts.

The fundamental thing that TCS does (both the schema and the way of =20
modeling) is separate TaxonNames (or nomenclatural acts) from =20
TaxonConcepts (actual delimited or implied taxa that one would =20
identify something to).

In order to issue LSIDs for TaxonNames or TaxonConcepts it is =20
necessary to represent them in RDF rather than XML Schema. RDF is far =20
more modular by nature than XML Schema and so two vocabularies were =20
put together to represent TaxonNames and TaxonConcepts (rather than =20
one schema) but unless you are issuing pure nomenclatural data you =20
will usually use both.

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonName

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonConcept

The TaxonName vocabulary is being used by IPNI, Index Fungorum and =20
soon ZooBank. It is also being used by GBIF and anyone else who uses =20
the TaxonConcept or TaxonOccurrence because it is embedded within =20
these vocabularies. In fact it could be used anywhere some one wants =20
to break apart a name string.

The TaxonOccurrence vocabulary is being issued by the CATE project =20
(don't have the reference to hand) and Species2k/Catalogue of life =20
are going to use it for their checklist and of course by others who =20
issue TaxonOccurrence data.

I'll show and example of the embedding as it makes things clearer. =20
This is abbreviated for clarity. Suppose we want to express an =20
occurrence of a taxon (perhaps as a specimen)

<to:TaxonOccurrence rdf:about=3D"urn:lsid:example.com:specimens:1234">
	<dc:title>Hyam.R.D. 284927 - Rhododendron ponticum L.</dc:title>
	<to:collector>Roger Hyam</to:collector>
	<.... other stuff ...>
	<to:identifiedTo>
		<to:Identification>
			<to:expertName>Chris Browning</to:expertName>
			<to:taxonName>Rhododendron ponticum
L.</to:taxonName>
			<to:taxon >
				<tc:TaxonConcept>
					<tc:hasName>
						<tn:TaxonName>
=09
<tn:genusPart>Rhododendron</tn:genusPart>
=09
<tn:specificEpithet>ponticum</tn:specificEpithet >
=09
<tn:authorship>L.</tn:authorship >
						<tn:TaxonName>
					</tc:hasName>
					<tc:accordingToString>Brown and

					<tcom:publishedIn>Some monograph by

					<tcom:publishedInCitation
rdf:reference=3D"http://=20
some.uri.to.some.citation.for.the.pub"/>
				</tc:TaxonConcept>
			</to:taxon>
		</to:Identification>=09
	</to:identifiedTo>
</to:TaxonOccurrence>

So we have a TaxonOccurrence (really like a DarwinCore record but =20
with embedding). In order to express the identification of this =20
specimen in more detail than just a string we include a TaxonConcept =20
and a TaxonName. Neither the concept nor the name have identities =20
(they are both anonymous) but they are both objects of that type. =20
They could be replaced by references to external instances. There are =20
also properties to allow the supplier to "cop-out" of embedding =20
referencing anything and simply include a string if that is all they =20
have in their database.

So in issuing a TaxonOccurrence record I use both TaxonConcept and =20
TaxonName vocabularies. I am not using TCS in the sense of the XML =20
Schema but I am using in the sense of the notions involved.

This is where we are  headed with integrated standards and semantic =20
approaches.

I hope this helps.

BTW I hope it answers Rich's question as it is possible to add =20
reference info in the TaxonConcept to say where it was published =20
using the common properties defined in:

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Common

All the best,

Roger

=C9amonn,

When I hear validity I always think "Valid for whom?" Maybe I am too =20
much of a relativist/liberal etc. Anyhow...

There are three scenarios

1) The consumer and producer of the document have an agreement that =20
the serialized RDF will agree with a particular XML Schema. It is not =20=

possible to include an schemaLocation attribute in serialized RDF so =20
this has to be asserted somewhere else. If you (as a consumer) are =20
using TAPIR then you will have specified the output model (an XML =20
Schema) when you asked for the data in the first place and the data =20
should be valid against that schema or the provider is being =20
naughty.  You could then validate it against another schema of your =20
own prior to import.

2) If you are not getting the RDF from TAPIR then you don't know the =20
document structure. It could be serialized in a number of ways. In =20
this case you should use an RDF parser (they are available for all =20
languages) to generate an in memory (or database backed) model and =20
programatically work over this to do as you please. Using the =20
resource centered approach your code would do things like get all the =20=

TaxonConcepts in the graph then work over them asking for properties =20
and values and doing something sensible with them. This is similar to =20=

what you would do if you got a schema validated XML document that you =20=

had bound to Java objects using JAXB or even if you read a valid =20
document into a DOM of some kind.

3) If you are a really sophisticated semantic web wise client you =20
would put RDF straight into a model (or triple store) with your own =20
ontology that made assertions about what it considered valid =20
TaxonConcepts. You would then just ask the model for a list of valid =20
TaxonConcepts.

I would be interested to meet anyone who is actually validating XML =20
documents they get back from a supplier using XML Schema and relying =20
on that validity alone to import the data into their own data model. =20
I have talked with people who generate Java from XML Schema but they =20
usually then mess with it to get it to work for their application.

If I received and ABCD document that wasn't valid for example I would =20=

have a choice of rejecting it entirely or trying to work out if the =20
bit that broke the validity effects my data model. If it is valid I =20
still have to check that the contents of the elements fit my model. =20
Whatever happens I have to walk over the DOM programatically so there =20=

seems little point in actually validating it first I may as well just =20=

let my own code fail in a way I understand and can recover from.

There is an analogy I use. When I post a letter I have to have a =20
valid envelope, stamp and address on it. I don't expect the postman =20
to open the letter and say "Hey that is bad grammar I am not =20
delivering it!".  When I read a letter I can understand it if the =20
grammar is bad in parts - especially if those parts are unimportant =20
to me. It might be valid to me but not to the postman.

(BTW there is a postal strike in the UK at the moment - not sure if =20
that strengthens the analogy or invalidates it)

I hope this helps,

Roger

One minor quibble about the metadata these LSIDs serve. The date in  
"dcterms" created doesn't conform to "best practice" (ghastly term).  
Dublin Core recommends using a scheme such as ISO 8601 (see http:// 
www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).

Dates such as "8/24/07 8:59 AM" in urn:lsid:cate- 
araceae.org:taxonconcepts:274386 can cause confusion (e.g., what time  
zone is being used? is the first digit a month or a day?, etc.).  
Something like

2007-08-27T08:59Z is unambiguous and computer friendly.

I only bring this up as anybody who was going to make use of these  
dates would have the painful task of fixing them. Let's try and avoid  
the mess that DiGIR providers have lumbered us with (see http:// 
semant.blogspot.com/2006/11/damn-digir.html ).

Hi Roger,

I was thinking "valid"  for a particular consumer who expected certain =
items
of data. For example, a GetCapabilities document in an OGC Web Map =
Service
is commonly validated before it is returned to a client.  So your first
scenario is something like the one I had in mind. As you pointed out
earlier, it is possible to add an arbitrary literature reference to the
TaxonConcept, but you might want to enforce that (in a relatively =
tightly
coupled system) by using an XML Schema. But I do like the RDF "open =
world"
approach and I assume that in scenarios 2 and 3, you could traverse the
relationships and find a link from a TaxonConcept to a literature ref in =
one
of the triples that get aggregated, i.e. each TaxonConcept instance does =
not
have to come packaged with a lit ref.

=C9amonn,

When I hear validity I always think "Valid for whom?" Maybe I am too =20
much of a relativist/liberal etc. Anyhow...

There are three scenarios

1) The consumer and producer of the document have an agreement that =20
the serialized RDF will agree with a particular XML Schema. It is not =20
possible to include an schemaLocation attribute in serialized RDF so =20
this has to be asserted somewhere else. If you (as a consumer) are =20
using TAPIR then you will have specified the output model (an XML =20
Schema) when you asked for the data in the first place and the data =20
should be valid against that schema or the provider is being =20
naughty.  You could then validate it against another schema of your =20
own prior to import.

2) If you are not getting the RDF from TAPIR then you don't know the =20
document structure. It could be serialized in a number of ways. In =20
this case you should use an RDF parser (they are available for all =20
languages) to generate an in memory (or database backed) model and =20
programatically work over this to do as you please. Using the =20
resource centered approach your code would do things like get all the =20
TaxonConcepts in the graph then work over them asking for properties =20
and values and doing something sensible with them. This is similar to =20
what you would do if you got a schema validated XML document that you =20
had bound to Java objects using JAXB or even if you read a valid =20
document into a DOM of some kind.

3) If you are a really sophisticated semantic web wise client you =20
would put RDF straight into a model (or triple store) with your own =20
ontology that made assertions about what it considered valid =20
TaxonConcepts. You would then just ask the model for a list of valid =20
TaxonConcepts.

I would be interested to meet anyone who is actually validating XML =20
documents they get back from a supplier using XML Schema and relying =20
on that validity alone to import the data into their own data model. =20
I have talked with people who generate Java from XML Schema but they =20
usually then mess with it to get it to work for their application.

If I received and ABCD document that wasn't valid for example I would =20
have a choice of rejecting it entirely or trying to work out if the =20
bit that broke the validity effects my data model. If it is valid I =20
still have to check that the contents of the elements fit my model. =20
Whatever happens I have to walk over the DOM programatically so there =20
seems little point in actually validating it first I may as well just =20
let my own code fail in a way I understand and can recover from.

There is an analogy I use. When I post a letter I have to have a =20
valid envelope, stamp and address on it. I don't expect the postman =20
to open the letter and say "Hey that is bad grammar I am not =20
delivering it!".  When I read a letter I can understand it if the =20
grammar is bad in parts - especially if those parts are unimportant =20
to me. It might be valid to me but not to the postman.

(BTW there is a postal strike in the UK at the moment - not sure if =20
that strengthens the analogy or invalidates it)

I hope this helps,

Roger

Eammon,

Yes WFS (not sure about WMS) is very similar to TAPIR.

In the mapping environment the data needs to be valid to put a point =20
or a map (or something more tricky) in our world it is a little more =20
complex what the validity is for. If you ask for a TaxonConcept and =20
it has a TaxonName embedded in it will the authority string of the TN =20=

be broken into basionym and combination authorship? Some providers =20
might be able to do this (but few). Is it valid not to include an =20
authority string at all? It is difficult to see how we would define a =20=

structure that would meet everyones needs.

The only way to do more validity testing in the transport layer is to =20=

have clearer use-cases. Perhaps I should say "Valid for what?" rather =20=

than "Valid for whom?".

All the best,

Roger

Hallo Robert &amp; Community<br>
<br>
That is a good question (that might best fit for a (non-existent) TDWG
metadata discussion list). <br>
<br>
I have used to put taxon names in the Subject
field in DC.&nbsp; Look at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://www.bioshare.net/dabuh">http://www.bioshare.net/dabuh</a>
for examples.&nbsp; But
it has been rather unstructured and there has been no attempt to embed
real TCS elements therein.<br>
<br>
The other alternative is to use the Coverage field of DC.&nbsp; There are
established conventions to embed spatial and temporal scope in an
XMLish way in Coverage.&nbsp; So why not figure out a similar syntax for
biological taxonomy?<br>
<br>
For those who don't know this tool, the Data Repository Tool is a
simple data warehouse tool that has DiGIR and TAPIR access points.&nbsp; It
organises content in a folder structure that has Dublin Core metadata
for the folders. The folders can hold data files that have a Dublin
Core header and Darwin Core records.&nbsp; It can serve any flatly organised
(denormalised) data.<br>
<br>
Regards, Hannu Saarenmaa<br>

This is a bit OT, but at least about metadata: I am curently preparing
some data in TCS schema and I plan to set up a OAI interface for data
exchange.<br>
According to the OAI specifications the use of dublin (NOT darwin..)
core formatted metadata is obligatory, so I will also try to offer
oai_dc metadata.<br>
  <br>
I would like to ask the group if there have been any discussions on
mapping TCS to DC before? Do you know of&nbsp; any attempts to model concept
or name metadata with DC?<br>

Dear all,

I just have finished a TCS XML  demo page at:
http://taxonconcept.stratigraphy.net/taxon_tcs?taxid=793
which is a TCS representation of synonym list (concepts) data on the taxon
'Subbotina patagonica' published by Berggren & Norris (1997) and Pearson et
al. (2006), see a html output here:
http://taxonconcept.stratigraphy.net/taxon_details?taxid=793

The XML valdates against the schema, but of course, what I have implemented
is a 'interpretation' of the standard, e.g. I have now summarized the two
synonymies to one DataSet, and I am not sure if this granularity makes
sense. So I would like to ask you to check if the output looks reasonable.

I was really happy to see how good TCS fits to my data and after I have seen
the first results I realized how good this fits to an experiment I was
trying some months ago:

I tried to apply the Google PageRank algorithm to synonymies and as a first
attempt I calculated what I called TaxonRank. I have provided some more info
on this here:
http://stratigraphynet.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-taxonrank-works.html (+ my
geoinformatics community prepared a special volume on ontologies etc and I
have also submitted a paper to Computers&Geosciences which will be published
soon).

After seeing the TCS XML output and reading many RDF and ontology related
mailing list contributions I wonder if anybody has ever thought about doing
something like this before?
My tests are on synonymy list (concepts) only, but I think similar
approaches could lead to interesting results also if applied to e.g.
genetics. And..wouldn't be ranking based on such ontologies a killer
application for GUIDs?
apologies for cross posting..

Robert

Dear all, <br><br>I just have finished a TCS XML&nbsp; demo page at:<br><a href="http://taxonconcept.stratigraphy.net/taxon_tcs?taxid=793">http://taxonconcept.stratigraphy.net/taxon_tcs?taxid=793</a><br>which is a TCS representation of synonym list (concepts) data on the taxon &#39;Subbotina patagonica&#39; published by Berggren &amp; Norris (1997) and Pearson et al. (2006), see a html output here:<br>
<a href="http://taxonconcept.stratigraphy.net/taxon_details?taxid=793">http://taxonconcept.stratigraphy.net/taxon_details?taxid=793</a><br><br>The XML valdates against the schema, but of course, what I have implemented is a &#39;interpretation&#39; of the standard, e.g. I have now summarized the two synonymies to one DataSet, and I am not sure if this granularity makes sense. So I would like to ask you to check if the output looks reasonable. <br>
<br>I was really happy to see how good TCS fits to my data and after I have seen the first results I realized how good this fits to an experiment I was trying some months ago:<br><br>I tried to apply the Google PageRank algorithm to synonymies and as a first <span style="font-style: italic;">attempt</span> I calculated what I called TaxonRank. I have provided some more info on this here: <br>
<a href="http://stratigraphynet.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-taxonrank-works.html">http://stratigraphynet.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-taxonrank-works.html</a> (+ my geoinformatics community prepared a special volume on ontologies etc and I have also submitted a paper to Computers&amp;Geosciences which will be published soon).<br>
<br>After seeing the TCS XML output and reading many RDF and ontology related mailing list contributions I wonder if anybody has ever thought about doing something like this before? <br>My tests are on synonymy list (concepts) only, but I think similar approaches could lead to interesting results also if applied to e.g. genetics. And..wouldn&#39;t be ranking based on such ontologies a killer application for GUIDs?<br>

I've argued in the past (e.g.,  
http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2006/01/finding-good-phylogenies-using.html  
) that PageRank-style algorithms can be applied to all manner of links,  
and there is research suggesting that even incomplete links can  
generate a useful ranking  
(http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2008/02/incomplete-citation-and- 
ranking.html ).

I've a manuscript in review for Briefings in Bioinformatics that  
applies PageRank to rank some ant specimens, based on links to images,  
sequences, and publications. I think there's enormous scope for  
exploring link graphs, and this is yet another reason for GUIDs -- the  
trick is to reuse them across multiple data sets. If we don't have  
shared identifiers then we won't be able to create the links. Hence, it  
is vital that we reuse GUIDs for taxonomic names and literature, or at  
a minimum have a mapping service that links alternative GUIDs for the  
same object. If each biodiversity project issues its own GUIDs for the  
same journal articles, for example, then there won't be many "killer  
apps".

Regards

Rod

(apologies if you receive this multiple times - we are trying to  
reach as many interested researchers from the taxonomic/systematic  
community as possible)

Under the umbrella of the Open Biomedical Ontologies project (OBO;  
http://obofoundry.org/) we have created a new mailing list, called  
obo-taxonomy, for the discussion of ontological representation of  
taxonomies and phylogenies.  The OBO Foundry supports the development  
of orthogonal, interoperable reference ontologies for biological  
science.

The Phenoscape project (http://phenoscape.org) develops methods and  
tools for using ontologies to integrate comparative morphological  
data with mutant phenotypes of genetic model organisms.  As such we  
are very interested in participation from members of the evolutionary  
biology community to explore how best to integrate taxonomy into an  
ontological framework.  Issues include proper semantics of the  
relationship between taxonomic groups, and between specimens and  
species.

Hi everybody,

I developed a Taxonomy Ontology related to some colombian species with 
trade
potential (the ontology is available at: 
http://biotradeontology.blogspot.com).

I also formulated some competence question for this Ontology, for instance:

What is the kingdom of <Lippia alba>?
How is <Amagris> clasify?
How is the instance <Faboidea clasify>?
What are the vernacular names of < Borojoa patinoi >?

I appreciate your comments, questions and everything that can help me to
improve the ontology, cheers.

J.

[ our apologies should you receive this message more than one time ]

    **************************************************************
       Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) 2008 Conference
          Friday 24th October 2008    Session 20: Wild Ideas
                http://www.tdwg.org/conference2008/
    **************************************************************

"Wouldn't it be cool if we had a tool to do...."
"Why don't we serve data like...."
"Check out this non OGC GIS system...."
"We need to copy the ideas of community...."
"This online data curation site is awesome...."
"Check what I can do with my super computer other than play World of  
Warcraft...."
"Cloud computing is allowing me to...."
"Google / Facebook / Flickr process data like this .... why don't we?"



We all have them - wild ideas - and now we all want to hear them.

Have you an idea that you could present for 15 minutes at the 2008  
TDWG conference in Perth?  Perhaps you have something that goes beyond  
the usual schemas, the usual harvesting model, the usual processing or  
visualisation?  There are no limitations, no boundaries other than it  
must relate somehow to biodiversity informatics.  Who knows, maybe you  
can generate some interest, start a working group and next year we'll  
be presenting a new working method.

If you have an idea, please mail Tim and Markus on trobertson@gbif.org  
and mdoering@gbif.org with a brief outline and we'll get back to you.

And if you have a presentation to give, but can't be there in person,  
maybe we can hook up a video link, you can ask someone else to present  
it for you or submit a video presentation?


Cheers

Markus and Tim

Dear TDWG groups,

I would like to inform you about a new TDWG mailing list that was =20
created today for discussing any TDWG standard definitions on a non =20
technical level.
The new list was created to help cross pollination of ideas between =20
the different TDWG groups and avoid the frequent duplication of work =20
that we have encountered so often in the past years.

Every subgroup is free to decide whether they want to freeze their =20
existing mailing list and migrate discussions to the central tdwg-=20
content list. If you want to take this step, please let me know and I =20=

will take the required actions. A frozen mailing list will disallow =20
any new posts or member subscriptions, but the existing archive will =20
continue to be publicly available. An autoresponder will also be =20
configured to inform future users of the new content list. By default =20=

I will transfer all existing subscriptions to the new list, so people =20=

don't have to subscribe again.

You can also subscribe manually to the new mailing list here:
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content


In addition to that, the 3 existing mailing lists that deal with =20
technical issues have already decided to hold all discussions from now =20=

on on the technical architecture group (TAG) list. The existing guid =20
and tapir mailing lists have been frozen today.

Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-tnc,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-tnc into tdwg-content. The list tdwg-tnc will be =
closed and removed once the archives have been merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=
