[ our apologies should you receive this message more than one time ]

    **************************************************************
       Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) 2008 Conference
          Friday 24th October 2008    Session 20: Wild Ideas
                http://www.tdwg.org/conference2008/
    **************************************************************

"Wouldn't it be cool if we had a tool to do...."
"Why don't we serve data like...."
"Check out this non OGC GIS system...."
"We need to copy the ideas of community...."
"This online data curation site is awesome...."
"Check what I can do with my super computer other than play World of  
Warcraft...."
"Cloud computing is allowing me to...."
"Google / Facebook / Flickr process data like this .... why don't we?"



We all have them - wild ideas - and now we all want to hear them.

Have you an idea that you could present for 15 minutes at the 2008  
TDWG conference in Perth?  Perhaps you have something that goes beyond  
the usual schemas, the usual harvesting model, the usual processing or  
visualisation?  There are no limitations, no boundaries other than it  
must relate somehow to biodiversity informatics.  Who knows, maybe you  
can generate some interest, start a working group and next year we'll  
be presenting a new working method.

If you have an idea, please mail Tim and Markus on trobertson@gbif.org  
and mdoering@gbif.org with a brief outline and we'll get back to you.

And if you have a presentation to give, but can't be there in person,  
maybe we can hook up a video link, you can ask someone else to present  
it for you or submit a video presentation?


Cheers

Markus and Tim

Hi,

are there any centroid data available for TDWG map level 4 areas with abbreviations as an ID field? A simple CSV table with ID, lat, lon would be sufficient for my purposes. Just asking if somebody has done this already or could easily do that. Thanks in advance!

Dear TDWG groups,

I would like to inform you about a new TDWG mailing list that was =20
created today for discussing any TDWG standard definitions on a non =20
technical level.
The new list was created to help cross pollination of ideas between =20
the different TDWG groups and avoid the frequent duplication of work =20
that we have encountered so often in the past years.

Every subgroup is free to decide whether they want to freeze their =20
existing mailing list and migrate discussions to the central tdwg-=20
content list. If you want to take this step, please let me know and I =20=

will take the required actions. A frozen mailing list will disallow =20
any new posts or member subscriptions, but the existing archive will =20
continue to be publicly available. An autoresponder will also be =20
configured to inform future users of the new content list. By default =20=

I will transfer all existing subscriptions to the new list, so people =20=

don't have to subscribe again.

You can also subscribe manually to the new mailing list here:
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content


In addition to that, the 3 existing mailing lists that deal with =20
technical issues have already decided to hold all discussions from now =20=

on on the technical architecture group (TAG) list. The existing guid =20
and tapir mailing lists have been frozen today.

Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-geospatial,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-geospatial into tdwg-content. The list =
tdwg-geospatial will be closed and removed once the archives have been =
merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=
