The Taxon Data Model list is now operational. To maintain continuity, I =
have
copied the relevant emails of the past week into an "archive" below. =
Please
use this list from now on to continue the discussions.

Best regards,

=C9amonn

-----Discussion on TDM that took place between 2 and 7 May 2007 -----


-------------------  from Renato
--------------------------------------------------------

OK, so I "think" I'm starting to understand the problem that has led to =
the
current approach taken by the taxon data model.

Trying to make a quite simplified analogy with specimen data, imagine a
collection that used a simple OCR process in all labels and now it has =
only
one table with a single textual field. Since we can find different =
things in
labels (some may have coordinates, others not, some may have collecting
date, etc.) the suggestion for this kind situation would then be to tag =
all
records individually. For instance saying that "in this specific record =
you
may find something about the location, in this other record you may find
something about location and date" and so on.

Now back to species databases, if tagging is really something at the =
record
level (and I suppose it is), I would be really surprised to see a =
species
database which is ready to use some kind of tagging mechanism. Tagging =
at
the record level would therefore require changing the data structure and
revising all records.=20

If this kind of work is being considered, then why not restructure
everything according to the new terminology that was proposed during the
meeting? Unless we are talking about some kind of data that simply =
cannot be
separated and structured according to the proposed terms...

Looking at the results of the meeting, it's really tempting to take all
terms and put them into a simple conceptual schema like DarwinCore. It =
would
not only provide a common XML vocabulary, but we would almost instantly
benefit from the existing technology for sharing/accessing distributed =
data.
>From the TAPIR perspective, data exchange schemas like PlinianCore could =
be
seen as output models.=20
All providers from the different networks could still try to map the =
same
agreed terms/concepts.

If tagging will not take place at the record level, but at the field =
level,
like "I have field X which sometimes has content about behaviour, =
sometimes
about evolution, sometimes both, so I will automatically tag all records
with both terms", then I see no big difference if in the current way of
using TAPIR we just take the two corresponding concepts and map them =
against
the same local field.

RDF could still be one of the TAPIR outputs, but the ontology would =
probably
need a different approach (as discussed in previous messages).

Hi Renato, Bob and all,

I am a new to this thread and I have not been able to go through it all, =
but
as some of you already know, for the IABIN Species and Specimens =
Thematic
Network we will be setting up TAPIR providers with information on =
Species
structured with the Plinian Core (www.pliniancore.org).  The first =
providers
will hopefully be ready by mid-year... our datasource (~4K Species =
records),
will hopefully be on-line in the next month...=20

Additionally, I would really like to try coding some of the information =
from
our Timber Tree Species from the Flora of Costa Rica to set up the TDM =
on
top of that, particularly looking for those that do not map well.

I promise to write back next week,

William Ulate
Coordinator
Biodiversity Informatics Unit
Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad, INBio.

P.S.: Where can I find the minutes/results of the Workshop?

Yes, but it is worse. Many such sources have \both/ textual---but

I am presently doing some of that, albeit first trying to hand code some
instances with Protege and Altova SemanticWorks. I guess the interesting
part will come for stuff that \doesn't/ map well. At the moment, I am
somewhat at a loss for what our intent was in this case, but maybe in
another few hours I will have figured that out. ...

Hello Roger,

Markus was right on his comment. I wasn't thinking about any particular
implementation of TAPIR, I just wanted to warn about some implications =
of
using generic models like TDM in the TAPIR context.

Take DarwinCore as an example:

* Most providers of specimen data use relational databases where Darwin
concepts correspond to table columns, so the mapping process is easier.
* If I'm a client and I'm interested in providers that have content for
lat/long, I can just inspect the capabilities response to see if they =
mapped
the corresponding concepts.
* Since we have different concept ids for each kind of data, we have =
more
possibilites when designing output models.

Now if I understood correctly, TDM is so generic that the same kind of =
model
could be used for DarwinCore - just replace the TDM terms by the Darwin
concepts. And although there's nothing intrinsically wrong with this
approach:

* If most providers will have databases where TDM categories correspond =
to
table columns, then they will need to prepare a super view to make all =
data
appear under a single InfoItem column, just beside another column with =
the
corresponding category value. It's possible, but it's more work for
providers and performance will not be good.
* If I'm a client and I'm interested in providers that have content for
habitat, I cannot simply inspect the capabilities response, because it =
will
just show me that the providers have InfoItems. I'll need to send =
additional
search/inventory requests to discover what kind of data is available.
* Since there will be only a few generic concepts, output models will be
very limited in TAPIR. As you know, at the moment we cannot have =
conditional
mappings in TAPIR, for instance: InfoItem corresponds to element habitat
only when category equals habitat.

I'm not against generic models. I also used them myself in specific
circumstances like meta modelling applications, or when the application =
had
such a mutable nature that it was better to use a more generic approach
(even at the cost of performance penalties and other additional work).

Anyway, I'm not quite familiar with species-level data sources. From the
previous messages, it seems that the main reason for using the generic
tagging approach is that most data sources will have chunks of text
including information about one or more TDM categories, and it will be
impractical to separate this information in a more structured way. Did I
understand the problem correctly?

In this case, then you're right that it would be interesting if someone
could investigate this a bit more, make some tests and give us a more
practical feedback. If most participants of the species model workshop =
have
this kind of database, maybe they could try to map their fields to the =
TDM
categories.

The inherited hierarchy of classes is not needed for semantics in both
approaches. We can derive *all* classes directly form the base InfoItem
class. Just as you are planning to do with the controlled vocabulary =
terms,
deriving them from BaseTerm. This kind of inheritance is more technical =
by
nature simply passing on all properties of InfoItems. The semantical
hierarchy InfoItem-  >BehaviorInfoItem->EvolutionaryBehaviorInfoItem can =
be
modelled in both approaches if we want. But in both ways we dont have =

Not really. I think the problem has to do with creating an XML schema to =
be
used for a TAPIR model that has *different* node paths to be mapped to.
Using the generic InfoItem "metamodel" you always end up with this path =
that
you map to:

/tdm:TaxonDataModel/tdm:hasInformation/tdm:InfoItem/tdmt:hasContent


instead of having different ones when using inheritance:
/tdm:TaxonDataModel/tdm:hasInformation/tdm:InfoItem/tdmt:Behaviour
/tdm:TaxonDataModel/tdm:hasInformation/tdm:InfoItem/tdmt:Evolution
/tdm:TaxonDataModel/tdm:hasInformation/tdm:InfoItem/
tdmt:BehaviouralEvolution

Hi Markus,

I am replying to this and cc'ing the TAG list because I really think we
should be having the discussion there. I am sure there are other people =
who
might like to be involve from a technical stand point. I hope they can =
read
this message thread backwards to catch up.

If I can summarize:

We are talking about the data models that were dreamt up at the
SpeciesDataModel workshop

http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TaxonDataModel
http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TDMTerm

The choice is whether to have an inherited hierarchy of classes of =
object to
represent information items or to have a single information item and =
'tag'
it with categories (instances).

Having info items as different classes means that they would be possibly =
be
clearer in a straight serialization.

<tdm:TaxonDataModel>
	<tdm:aboutTaxon>.....</tdm:aboutTaxon>
	<tdm:hasInformation>
		<tdmt:Behaviour>
			<tdmt:hasContent>Some stuff about
behaviour</tdmt:hasContent>
		</tdmt:Behaviour>
	</tdm:hasInformation>
	<tdm:hasInformation>
		<tdmt:Evolution>
			<tdmt:hasContent>Some stuff about
evolution</tdmt:hasContent>
		</tdmt:Evolutionr>
	</tdm:hasInformation>
	<tdm:hasInformation>
		<tdmt:BehaviouralEvolution>
			<tdmt:hasContent>Some stuff about evolution of
behaviour</ tdmt:hasContent>
		</tdmt:BehaviouralEvolution>
	</tdm:hasInformation>
</tdm:TaxonDataModel>

But taking the tagging approach:

<tdm:TaxonDataModel>
	<tdm:aboutTaxon>.....</tdm:aboutTaxon>
	<tdm:hasInformation>
		<tdm:InfoItem>
			<tdm:category
rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Behaviour"/>
			<tdmt:hasContent>Some stuff about
behaviour</tdmt:hasContent>
		</tdm:InfoItem>
	</tdm:hasInformation>
	<tdm:hasInformation>
		<tdm:InfoItem>
			<tdm:category
rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Evolution"/>
			<tdmt:hasContent>Some stuff about
evolution</tdmt:hasContent>
		</tdm:InfoItem>
	</tdm:hasInformation>
	<tdm:hasInformation>
		<tdm:InfoItem>
			<tdm:category
rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Behaviour"/>
			<tdm:category
rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Evolution"/>
			<tdmt:hasContent>Some stuff about evolution of
behaviour</ tdmt:hasContent>
		</tdm:InfoItem>
	</tdm:hasInformation>
</tdm:TaxonDataModel>

Renato raised questions about serving that tagged version with TAPIR by
which I think he meant TAPIRLink as it would not be possible to do the =
above
example as a flat schema. This is the same problem as serving multiple
identifications for a specimen I guess - is this right?

Reminds me of the point  I think Markus raised it at the beginning. =20
Why not have InfoItem as the top level element and move the taxon into =
it?

<InfoItem>
	<aboutTaxon>...</aboutTaxon>
	<category rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Evolution"/>
	<hasContent>Some stuff about evolution</hasContent> </InfoItem>

Info item is then like a DwC record and the category property is like =
the
BasisOfRecord. (TAPIRLink couldn't do multiple category stuff).

The argument against this is that the metadata would have to be repeated =
for
multiple InfoItems. Most requests would be for multiple InfoItems about =
the
same species - I guess but I really need clearer examples as to what =
this
will be applied to. Who is going to implement this in the near future?
Perhaps they should have a go and decide? Isn't Wouter doing something =
on
it? I don't have the time just now to try out some examples and I think =
that
is what is needed.

What does everyone else think?

All the best,

Roger

yes, so the definition of what the infoitem is about is a separate =
ontology,
thats what I naively called "domain" ontology before. This can be a =
simple
list of terms or a hierarchical list. I suspect you aim at the flat list =
to
avoid inheritance for reasons given in the TAG wiki.

yes. As Renato has mentioned in a related parallel discussion this also
allows us to create TAPIR models, cause an XML schema for these classes
would have different element names and thus become mappable easily.

I dont understand your intention here. If you want a more specific =
infoitem
about evolutionary-behaviour why not define a new class?

alright, so one idea about having a category property is that it allows =
you
to "tag" one fact (infoitem) with several categories. Is that a =
requirement
you had in mind when designing TDM?

well, not really. If all InfoItem instances are bundled through the
TDMClass, you know all of the instances in there are InfoItems. And I =
cant
see a difference for an ignorant application in not understanding the =
class
name or not understanding the category class. =20
For OWL aware applications on the other hand this gives extra knowledge
which is not as easy to get if you have to understand the categories =
"domain
ontology" / controlled vocabulary (Because you would need to know OWL =
AND
know how to interpret the non-OWL category
property)

exactly this will be a problem if everything is an InfoItem...

The attraction of doing it this way to me (and I think Donald=20

InfoItems without knowing what they are. If the client hadn't heard
of Behaviour it could do nothing with a class based examples unless

the properties that it didn't understand. Effectively every client

Altova SemanticWorks) than anything else, but it has given me an
appreciation of the simultaneous advantage and pain of being able to =
ignore
classes, or not, with OWL. My experience is very possibly due to naive,
learning-effect use of the tools so may not be worth much. It arises =
from my
initial annoyance with Protege for not recursively importing what seemed =
to
me to be the most central TDWG ontologies that TDM itself references
directly or indirectly, notably TDMTerm and TaxonConcept. [I don't yet =
know
what Altova does about this]. My annoyance began to turn to gratitude
when--with more and more stuff in TDM that happens to not be represented =
in
EFG data--I became relieved about the more and more stuff that \wasn't/ =
in
my face when I would never use it. [The instance management tools ought
themselves to be semantically aware. I should be able to tell =
Protege---or
better, it should learn---what I care about...]=20

</naive>

If an application (particular thematic network) really did want a=20
BehaviourInfoItem class it could define one itself.

<owl:Class rdf:ID=3D"BehaviourInfoItem">
   <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/=20
Base#InfoItem"/>
   <owl:equivalentClass>
     <owl:Restriction>
       <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=3D"tdm:category" />
       <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=3D" http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Behaviour" />
     </owl:Restriction>
   </owl:equivalentClass>
</owl:Class>

Yes, but... this will not solve the problem of proliferation of concepts =
and
the  need to relate them to one another when applications \don't/ want =
to
ignore them. The only maxim that the open world assumption addresses is
"ignorance is bliss". It leaves you on your own to deal with "a little =
bit
of knowledge is a dangerous thing."=20


"A little learning is a dangerous thing;=20
drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:=20
there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,=20
and drinking largely sobers us again."=20

the maxim, according to phrase.com=20

"Yet ah! why should they know their fate?=20
Since sorrow never comes too late,=20
And happiness too swiftly flies.=20
Thought would destroy their paradise.=20
No more; where ignorance is bliss,=20
'Tis folly to be wise"=20

I propose these two poems as the TDWG standard for the poetic =
representation
of RDF. :-)


Which I believe would give the same inferences that would be found by
going with subclasses (though I am no expert).


Nor I, but this smells like a place where  application writers would  =
find
themselves staring into the fiery pit of OWL Full. Remember that classes
cannot be instances in OWL DL, i.e. there is no Class class. This is =
very
annoying in OOP and makes code-reuse harder.  If reasoning with =
subclasses
turns out to require a Class class, then modeling TDM that way removes =
it
from first order logic.



The important thing is that we keep the instance data as simple and
stable as possible and impose meaning later.=20


As we know, "instance data is simple" to biologists means "instance data =
is
a row in a spreadsheet".  Hah, hah, just serious. Further, close to the =
only
cell entry tolerable is text, a URL, or the file name of an image.=20




If we were working in a pure semantic web world I would be more
inclined to go down the class based route but we have to also deal=20
with instance data as if it were plain XML documents that we can use
through TAPIR, validate with XML Schema and transform with XSLT.

We could always change the definitions of the tdm:hasValue property
(and the others) so that they inherit from a high level property.=20
This kind of change is good because it doesn't affect the instance data.

Have I understood your points correctly or have I just gone off on a
circle explaining something that is completely off track?

Hi Markus,

I have downsized the cc list for this discussion as I think it may be =
just
confusing to the less technically focussed or otherwise involved people =
who
would rather just hear the answer.

I am not sure I totally follow you. Currently InfoItem.category property =
has
a range of DefinedTerm which means anything that it should contain an
instance of DefinedTerm - i.e. the simplified controlled vocabulary =
things
we are using. It should perhaps have a range of
http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TDMTerm#TDMTerm.

Are you suggesting that we have different InfoItem child classes one for
each of the categories we are talking about (as listed here
http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/TDMTerm)?

So we would have

  <owl:Class rdf:ID=3D"EvolutionInfoItem">
	<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/
Base#InfoItem"/>
</owl:Class>

and

  <owl:Class rdf:ID=3D"BehaviourInfoItem">
	<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/
Base#InfoItem"/>
</owl:Class>

etc.

And that instance data would look like this:

<bii:BehaviourInfoItem>
	<ii:hasContent>Some stuff about behaviour</ii:hasContent>
</bii:Behaviour>

If you had evolutionary-behaviour data you might do this

<bii:BehaviourInfoItem rdf:about=3D"1233">
	<rdf:type rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
EvolutionInfoItem#EvolutionInfoItem"/>
	<ii:hasContent>Some stuff about evolution of
behaviour</ii:hasContent> </bii:Behaviour>

Here we say that the thing 1233 is an instance of both classes.

The same instance data the way we came up with it at the meeting would =
look
like this:

<tdm:InfoItem>
	<tdm:category rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Evolution"/>
	<tdm:category rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Behaviour"/>
	<tdm:hasContent>Some stuff about evolution of behaviour</
tdm:hasContent> </tdm:InfoItem>

The attraction of doing it this way to me (and I think Donald suggested =
it)
was that it is easy to write a client that will digest InfoItems without
knowing what they are. If the client hadn't heard of Behaviour it could =
do
nothing with a class based examples unless it was capable of exploring =
the
class hierarchy and finding something it did know about and even then =
there
may have been restrictions on the properties that it didn't understand.
Effectively every client would need to know OWL.

If an application (particular thematic network) really did want a
BehaviourInfoItem class it could define one itself.

<owl:Class rdf:ID=3D"BehaviourInfoItem">
   <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/
Base#InfoItem"/>
   <owl:equivalentClass>
     <owl:Restriction>
       <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=3D"tdm:category" />
       <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=3D"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/
TDMTerm#Behaviour" />
     </owl:Restriction>
   </owl:equivalentClass>
</owl:Class>

Which I believe would give the same inferences that would be found by =
going
with subclasses (though I am no expert).

The important thing is that we keep the instance data as simple and =
stable
as possible and impose meaning later.

If we were working in a pure semantic web world I would be more inclined =

the

--------------  from Marcus ---------------------------------------

Roger,
thanks for this. The wiki guide really is a good advice and we should
probably not use inheritance to model the domain ontology. We might use =
it
carefully for more "technical" decisions like shared "global" =20
properties, e.g. in the case of the Base#DefinedTerm class you created =
to
derive all terms used for a controlled vocabulary from.

But I still believe there is a difference from the Cat example in the =
wiki
and the InfoItem class. The InfoItem class doesn't use concrete =
properties,
like Cat::hasMarkings in your example, but rather uses a very flexible,
generic property Info::hasValue or Info::hasContent. =20
And exactly that abstraction makes me feel uncomfortable. We have to use
another property "Info::category" to give semantics to the other
value/content property. I doubt that any reasoner understands that (even =
if
dont make use of them).

The alternatives in my previous message don't have to use much of
inheritance in any case.
Applying A (using a common InfoItem Base Class) leaves us with the same
situation that we have now. Instead of deriving terms in the domain =
ontology
from Base#DefinedTerm we derive them from Base#InfoItem. And voila, we =
dont
need the category property anymore.

Applying "pattern B", i.e. deriving all properties from a base property,
doesn't mean we have to use inheritance to model the domain. We can =
still
derive all properties from a basic hasFact property for example. In this
case (which I still feel is the most natural way of doing this) hasSize =
and
hasDescription exist in parallel, but you would at least know they are a
property of a taxon and that they have a value (either free text or a =
term
from a list, using datatype or object property respectively). We would =
use
inheritance mainly as a "technical" mean and not to model a hierarchy of
properties for a taxon.

Hi Roger,

I'm not sure I share this vision of a "law of conservation of pain".
It's true that one of the points in the other message was to ease the 
process of sharing data, but this doesn't mean that clients will 
necessarily have trouble (I hope not!).

>From the TAPIR perspective, we handle extensibility by allowing 
providers to work with multiple conceptual schemas. If you produce a 
list of concepts from the TDM terms, anyone is free to produce other 
complementary lists in the future, without breaking compatibility.

You know that in TAPIR it's also possible to produce outputs in 
different XML formats, even RDF. This should facilitate the work of 
clients. 

I suppose that clients will usually request data in formats that 
include elements that they know something about. But anyway, nothing 
prevents them to request things that they don't have any knowledge 
about. The TapirLink browser that I demonstrated during the TAPIR 
workshop is one of those clients: it dynamically builds an output 
model based on what the provider declared to have, and it simply 
displays this data in a tabular form.

Now let's assume that we decide to work with a generic conceptual 
schema with two main concepts, category of InfoItem and InfoItem 
value. Let's also assume that providers will be able to easily share 
their data according to this conceptual model. In TAPIR, the output 
formats will be very limited - they will need to follow this generic 
approach. But let's suppose that this will not be a problem.
What is going to happen is that clients will get amost anything from 
there - basically values of things that can be categorised in many 
ways. If clients want to perform validation they will need to do it 
themselves (the output format will be too generic, so we cannot use 
XML validation). Perhaps RDF validation will offer more 
possibilities, but then you're only considering data exchange in an 
RDF world. The meaning of InfoItems you would get from a dictionary 
of categories, in the same way that you could get the meaning of 
elements from a dictionary (DarwinCore for instance, or some 
ontology).

In this case, it's not clear to me what would be the big benefits of 
using the generic model approach, but maybe I'm missing something.
The more knowledge you have about the elements or concepts, the more 
interesting and powerful the applications will be. It's a 
philosophical issue. 

If we decide to avoid the more "traditional" way of structuring and 
modelling data because we feel it somehow limits our applications, 
then I think we first need to clearly understand what are these 
limitations. Otherwise, by doing things in a very different way we 
may miss the opportunity of using existing tools and resources - but 
still running the risk of facing again in a different road the same 
data structuring issues that we tried to avoid.

Best Wishes,
--
Renato

Hi Renato,

There was something bothering me about this discussion and it just  
occurred to me what it was...

It really doesn't matter whether we go down the route of subclassing  
InfoItems. From the point of view of the ontology perhaps this is a  
place where we should do it.

People working in pure semantic web way should be able to work out  
that anything that subclasses InfoItem is an info item.

People working in pure XML will prefer to have separately named  
elements to use.

People who want to produce serializations of RDF type data that look  
like tagged InfoItems can just use the rdfs:type property to tag  
their InfoItem instances.

So I am converted! In this case lets have subclasses of InfoItem.

We just need some one to volunteer to update the vocabulary files -  
or they will get put on the end of my do-list.

All the best,

Roger

Hi,
I volunteer and have just updated the ontology. Every TDMTerm  
instance now is a class like that one here:

    <owl:Class rdf:ID="TaxonBiology">
       <rdfs:label>Taxon Biology Info Item</rdfs:label>
       <dc:title>Taxon Biology</dc:title>
       <base:definition>An account of the biology of the taxon.</ 
base:definition>
       <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/ 
TaxonDataModel#InfoItem"/>
       <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/ 
voc/TaxonDataModel"/>
    </owl:Class>


Roger, could you check if I didnt do any stupid move?
Btw, is there any online validator anyone would recommend to validate  
our ontologies?

best wishes

Markus

Roger,
this was not targeted directly at TDM. I was mainly exploring OWL and =20=

definitely not suggesting multiple inheritance!

But in regards to TDM I was thinking about the consequences of =20
allowing any defined term as a "controlled" value for =20
InfoItems.hasValue.  Is this desired? Having individual classes for =20
the InfoItem categories now would allow us to define a specific =20
controlled vocabulary for each category - or None if we dont think =20
this is a good idea. These vocabularies, like CyclicityTerm, can =20
easily be extended by anyone who really needs to. And all InfoItems =20
are allowed to contain uncontrolled values via the hasContent =20
property in any case.

Im not sure why we are talking about inheritance.

My primary goal is to see how useful TDM is for data exchange and =20
integration. I am very interested for example to use TDM to exchange =20
species distribution data. If every application defines its own =20
occurence status terminology noone would be able to merge datasets. =20
So I was hoping TDWG would at least define a default standard for =20
those kind of things. I am aware that some communities will use a =20
different standard, but if they want to be interoperable with the =20
outside world how can you see this happen if we dont define a common =20
terminology? Reason over hundreds of SameAs statements? It would be =20
nice to have at least a standard "backbone" where you can relate your =20=

terminology against.

And if we agree that this is needed, why not have a strongly typed =20
property for the respective InfoItem classes that only allows terms =20
of the recommended terminology? But maybe I misinterpreted the =20
purpose of TDM and/or are still too heavily influenced by xml schema ;)

cheers

    Dear Taxon Data Model group members,

    This is to inform you that the group mailing list web and email 
addresses as well as the group wiki web address have changed. The new 
addresses are:

http://wiki.tdwg.org/TaxonDataModel (wiki homepage - short URL)
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TaxonDataModel/WebHome (wiki 
homepage - full URL)

http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/taxon-data-model (mailing list 
information web page)
taxon-data-model@lists.tdwg.org (mailing list web address)

    Please use the new email address above to post messages to all 
mailing list members.

    The old addresses of the resources above (that use the abbreviation 
Taxon Model, including the mailing list email address) have all been 
redirected to the new versions so that no external links are broken.

    The changes were made to address some concerns that have been raised 
that the abbreviation from Taxon Data Model to Taxon Model might lead to 
confusion and suggest that the group is concerned with taxonomy theory.

    Best regards,

Ricardo Pereira
TDWG Systems Administrator

Better(?) is Mindswap's Pellet Owl Consistency Checker 
http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/demo.shtml

If I am not misusing it, I believe that so far TDM requires OWL Full, 
but it looks like maybe trivial adjustments are necessary to make it DL.

May a plague rain down on the Open World Assumption. It provides 
misplaced comfort to OWL newbies like me. The Mindswap tool seems to add 
some medicine to cure my OWL sneezing.

Markus,

I agree but...

TDWG does have a "Plant Occurrence and Status Scheme" though it isn't =20=

linked to from the existing site it soon will be and perhaps we =20
should have a RDF/OWL version of it for backwards compatibility if =20
nothing else. I was just looking at it as I am trying to map a =20
database that uses the codes it contains along with codes from other =20
of the older schemas.

In the main exchange ontology we should restrict as little as =20
possible. If some one want to define another ontology that does =20
restrict the values and is used together with the main ontology then =20
they can. If the additional, restricting ontology is useful then it =20
can be standardized.

If the main exchange ontology is more strongly typed then we have to =20
loosen it up later which I believe is harder and will prevent the =20
flow of data.

To use a cowboy analogy. If we are going to lasso a cow we should =20
start with a loose loop of rope and then tighten it. If start with a =20
tight loop we will never get it over the cows head.

A classic example of this is the 'year' field in TCS. It should =20
contain a year so we restricted it to being a gYear but we received =20
strong feedback saying "We want to use TCS but can't because we want =20
to put a range of years or a measure of uncertainty in that field". =20
It would have been better if we had not restricted that year field so =20=

that more people could use the standard as a whole.

Hope this helps,

Roger

Hi All,

There is a tentative schedule for the TDWG conference in Bratislava, =
16-23
September on:
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Executive/Tdwg2007ConferenceSchedule

Included are two slots of particular interest to our Taxon Data Model =
(most
likely to be changed yet again to "Taxon Information Model" to avoid
confusion with taxonomy models):

Tuesday 16.00-18.00 Tuesday 18 Sept:
Group meetings: a block of time for interest and task or joint group
meetings=20

Wednesday 08.30-10.00 Wednesday 19 Sept:
Special session devoted to Taxon Data Model

I'd like to get an idea of numbers interested in attending these =
sessions so
let me know if you and/or colleagues plan to attend the conference. It =
will
be a good opportunity to report on progress and, most importantly, hold
discussions with other groups whose interests overlap with ours.

Best regards,

=C9amonn

After some discussion on the TDWG convenors list we have changed what we
were originally calling "Taxon Data Model" to "Species Profile Model" to
disambiguate it from other TDWG standards. The message was that we =
should
keep it as clear and simple as possible and that, while we might be =
dealing
with taxanomic groups other than species, this latter term, rather than
"taxon", was best.

SPM seems fine to me. Is it OK to call it SPaM or should it be SPoMo =20
or something?

So now we have a name what about a definition?

We have no way of deciding between different design options if we =20
don't have primary use-cases or usage scenarios nailed down.

Just like in any scientific endeavor we need testable hypotheses.

What I would suggest is that we come up with some tests to see if the =20=

SPM is any good. We can then design SPM so it at least passes these =20
tests. Without setting some goal posts like these we will just go =20
round and round in circles.

Presumably there is stuff about discoverability of data and merging =20
of different species profiles.

Any offers to flesh this out?

All the best,

Roger

=C9amonn,

I have prepared a simple SpeciesPage example based on the current =20
ontology.
http://ww3.bgbm.org/tmp/abiesalba.rdf

I hope this helps and also that it's really correct. At least it =20
validates with w3c's validator.
You can also view it with the new AJAX based OpenLink RDF browser:
http://demo.openlinksw.com/DAV/JS/rdfbrowser/index.html

two things struck me when writing this example:
- where do I put a PublicationCitation? I would want to cite all =20
sources for every information and I dont know where/how. Is this =20
missing or part of the base/core ontology already?
- hasInformation is a bit redundant, but the validator did complain =20
when I declared all InfoItems under a single hasInformation node. Was =20=

this intended? I guess yes, cause otherwise the InfoItems would have =20
to be properties.

best wishes

Markus

Markus' comment that he would like to use TDM to exchange species
distribution data prompts me to comment that the invasive species data
standard (IASPS) aims to do exactly that.=20

It includes a few elements that are specific to the needs of the =
invasive
species community such as BioStatus which is comprised of Origin, =
Presence,
Persistence, Distribution (i.e. Widespread, Moderate, Localized, =
Unknown),
Abundance, Trend, Rate of spread, Harmful, Regulatory listing, plus
ImpactStatus and DispersalStatus, but otherwise its purpose is to =
facilitate
the exchange of species distribution data.

Markus,

I agree but...

TDWG does have a "Plant Occurrence and Status Scheme" though it isn't =20
linked to from the existing site it soon will be and perhaps we =20
should have a RDF/OWL version of it for backwards compatibility if =20
nothing else. I was just looking at it as I am trying to map a =20
database that uses the codes it contains along with codes from other =20
of the older schemas.

In the main exchange ontology we should restrict as little as =20
possible. If some one want to define another ontology that does =20
restrict the values and is used together with the main ontology then =20
they can. If the additional, restricting ontology is useful then it =20
can be standardized.

If the main exchange ontology is more strongly typed then we have to =20
loosen it up later which I believe is harder and will prevent the =20
flow of data.

To use a cowboy analogy. If we are going to lasso a cow we should =20
start with a loose loop of rope and then tighten it. If start with a =20
tight loop we will never get it over the cows head.

A classic example of this is the 'year' field in TCS. It should =20
contain a year so we restricted it to being a gYear but we received =20
strong feedback saying "We want to use TCS but can't because we want =20
to put a range of years or a measure of uncertainty in that field". =20
It would have been better if we had not restricted that year field so =20
that more people could use the standard as a whole.

Hope this helps,

Roger

Michael,
you are right that IASPS is covering pretty much the same domain. =20
TDWG really does need more integration of the multitude of =20
"standards" that have been produced, though most of them are rarely =20
seen in production. This is why I am hoping for the TDWG lsid =20
vocabularies which so far have been under tight control by Roger and =20
are integrating a diverse mix of data types. The SpeciesProfileModel =20
serves the purpose for our distribution data while at the same time =20
being integrated with other standards, most importantly TCS, through =20
the ontology. Maybe we should think of bringing IASPS into the ontology?

Dear Marcus,

I took the liberty of adding your example to the TDM wiki here:
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/TaxonDataModel/InstanceExamples

That is the best place for further discussion. I have also added your
initial comments there and posed a follow-on question about putting a
tp:PublicationCitation under every spm:hasInformation element when you =
want
to cite a source for its content.

Best regards,

=C9amonn

=C9amonn,

I have prepared a simple SpeciesPage example based on the current =20
ontology.
http://ww3.bgbm.org/tmp/abiesalba.rdf

I hope this helps and also that it's really correct. At least it =20
validates with w3c's validator.
You can also view it with the new AJAX based OpenLink RDF browser:
http://demo.openlinksw.com/DAV/JS/rdfbrowser/index.html

two things struck me when writing this example:
- where do I put a PublicationCitation? I would want to cite all =20
sources for every information and I dont know where/how. Is this =20
missing or part of the base/core ontology already?
- hasInformation is a bit redundant, but the validator did complain =20
when I declared all InfoItems under a single hasInformation node. Was =20
this intended? I guess yes, cause otherwise the InfoItems would have =20
to be properties.

best wishes

Bob has created a page on the Species Profile Model wiki for instance
examples (http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SPM/InstanceExamples).  =
You
are all encouraged to put your own examples there and add comments too.

In reaction to the AbiesAlba example and observations from Marcus, I =
have
put up one on SalmoSalar and posed some further questions.=20

Please contribute.

Best regards,

Hello there,

As you probably know, TDWG are devoting a special session to the Species
Profile Model at the upcoming Bratislava conference. It is scheduled for
08.30 to 10.00 on Wed 19 Sept and we hope to fill the slot with up to =
six
short (10-15 min) presentations. Marcus has already agreed to talk about =
the
modelling aspects of SPM on which he has been working (see the wiki  for
more info: http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SPM/InstanceExamples).

You are invited to make suggestions for contributions to this session. =
Any
aspect can be considered - vocabularies, use cases, relationship to =
other
species profile schemas, etc. Or do you know of a potential contribution
from another TDWG member outside this immediate subtask group? I intend =
to
mail a request for contributions to the wider TDWG community later in =
the
week but, in the meantime, would welcome your input.

Best regards,

=C9amonn

Thanks, Bob. I think this could be very informative in helping people =
get to
grips with RDf and SPM. I'll add you to the list.

I can give a little demo of how Protege and Altova SemanticWorks can
help one come to terms (pun intended) with SPM. An abstract might be
something like this:

----
Coming to Terms with SPM/RDF.
Although the ultimate point is to generate SPM programmatically, the
use of tools like Protege and Altova SemanticWorks can ease the
learning burden, and of course serve as a debugging aid, if properly
configured. I  will discuss, with demonstration, how I used these
tools to come to terms with SPM.
----

Actually, someone should probably give a survey of tools at least by
name and function, and it should be on the wiki in advance. But a
stroll through Protege and SemanticWorks after such a talk would
warrant 15 minutes, I think.

Please move all further discussion to the SPM list at TDWG
(tdwg-spm@lists.tdwg.org) so that we can be more inclusive and ensure =
that
items are archived for future reference. We should also start making use =
of
the SPM wiki again (http://wiki.tdwg.org/SPM/) as the focal point for
sharing information.

Thanks. Current looks OK as to RDF.  It, and parts (all?) of the LSID
voc and the TDWG core are OWL Full when they are meant to be and
probably easily could be OWL DL. Possibly nobody but me and Dave Thau
care about such things right now....Certainly it doesn't impede
plazi's project to generate SPM from TaxonX.

The Manchester Wonder Web OWL Species Validator pointed out to me by
Dave gives lots of hints that are probably easy to address. See
http://www.mygrid.org.uk/OWL/Validator  Some "FIXME" notes in core
ontolgies seem to suggest that Roger knew this and ran out of time to
address it. Most issues seem to be lack of explicit typing and lack of
separation of classes from instances. See also
http://wonderweb.semanticweb.org/owl/rdf.shtml. I'll look into it at
my leisure.

More important is to get some discussion going about the InfoItems.

Bob

Subject: Species Profile Model side meeting at e-Biosphere '09

 

Greetings,

 

We had an informal meeting to discuss SPM at the TDWG meeting in Australia.
In order to move the standard forward, I agreed to help coordinate future
development of the standard. At the next TDWG meeting we should have a more
formal session to do some real work on the standard. However, there are a
few things we can do in advance. 1) we can rejuvenate this mailing list,
making sure that everyone who wants to be involved is part of the
discussion, and 2) we can have a side meeting at the e-Biosphere meeting in
London June 1-3. My understanding is that there are free spaces available
for this and I will look into availability and timing.

 

How many people on this list would be able (and interested) to attend such a
meeting? Those who are not already planning to be at e-Biosphere we could
involve via the mailing list.

 

Thanks,

Cyndy

had an informal meeting to discuss SPM at the TDWG meeting in Australia. =

order to move the standard forward, I agreed to help coordinate future

a few
things we can do in advance. 1) we can rejuvenate this mailing list, =
making
sure that everyone who wants to be involved is part of the discussion, =

we can have a side meeting at the e-Biosphere meeting in London June =
1-3. My

into availability and timing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thanks for those who responded positively regarding an SPM meeting while at
e-Biosphere in London next week.

It looks like there may be up to 8 of us. One option is to have dinner
together on Tuesday, June 2. The other option is to find a quiet place
during Session 12, the afternoon of Wednesday. I have inquired if there is
any meeting space available for Session 12, but as requests for that space
were due back in April I do not expect we will be accommodated.

Please contact me privately at parrc@si.edu if you would be able to attend
an informal dinner on Tuesday night. I will post the final time and location
on a bulletin board at the conference on Monday, and I will also send a
message to the group.

Thanks in advance,
Cyndy

Folks,

Apologies to those who are not at the conference.

I have made a reservation for 7:30 p.m. dinner for us Tuesday night at the
Albert, a pub with an upstairs dining room at 52 Victoria Street,
Westminster, London. The cross street is Buckingham Gate.

I'm sorry for conflicts that I know that some of you have. We'll use this
meeting to get to know each other better and think about future directions
for the SPM standard. Come prepared with your experiences and ideas. But
we'll save much of the serious discussion for this list and for TDWG in
Montpelier.

Cyndy

For those of you on this list attending TDWG 2009 in Montpellier, today is
the deadline for submitting preferences for the sessions.

I strongly encourage you to submit your preference to attend the
SPM/Biological Description Interest group working sessions which are
Sessions 6 and 7 on Tuesday. Gregor and I have planned back-to-back sessions
as scope of standards like SPM and SDD range from general descriptive
summaries to more atomized descriptions, and one of the things we need to do
is discuss how best to ensure semantic connections across databases and
schemas so that discovery and analysis can proceed intelligently, no matter
what the scale of the original data.

In Session 6 we will have only two or three introductory talks to set the
stage for discussion on a mechanism for proposing and approving new terms
and relationships that takes advantage of the fact that SPM is an
RDF-oriented standard.  What I have in mind is taking advantage of GBIF's
vocabulary server to extend SPM; we'd also take maximum advantage of this as
we aggregate information on Encyclopedia of Life. The general idea is to
promote inclusiveness in vocabulary while ensuring that SPM can help tie
species-level descriptions together in machine readable ways. We'll also
talk about refining some of the definitions of existing terms that have
proven difficult in practice.  I will send out some background material this
week in preparation for this discussion.

Perhaps Gregor can comment on the goals for Session 7.

Cyndy

For those of you on this list attending TDWG 2009 in Montpellier, today is =
the deadline for submitting preferences for the sessions.<br><br>I strongly=
 encourage you to submit your preference to attend the SPM/Biological Descr=
iption Interest group working sessions which are Sessions 6 and 7 on Tuesda=
y. Gregor and I have planned back-to-back sessions as scope of standards li=
ke SPM and SDD range from general descriptive summaries to more atomized de=
scriptions, and one of the things we need to do is discuss how best to ensu=
re semantic connections across databases and schemas so that discovery and =
analysis can proceed intelligently, no matter what the scale of the origina=
l data.<br>
<br>In Session 6 we will have only two or three introductory talks to set t=
he stage for discussion on a mechanism for proposing and approving new term=
s and relationships that takes advantage of the fact that SPM is an RDF-ori=
ented standard.=A0 What I have in mind is taking advantage of GBIF&#39;s vo=
cabulary server to extend SPM; we&#39;d also take maximum advantage of this=
 as we aggregate information on Encyclopedia of Life. The general idea is t=
o promote inclusiveness in vocabulary while ensuring that SPM can help tie =
species-level descriptions together in machine readable ways. We&#39;ll als=
o talk about refining some of the definitions of existing terms that have p=
roven difficult in practice.=A0 I will send out some background material th=
is week in preparation for this discussion.<br>
<br>Perhaps Gregor can comment on the goals for Session 7.<br><br>Cyndy<br>=

The choice of sessions Cynthia mentioned will help the organizers
planning the size of rooms. It can be found here:

  http://www.tdwg.org/conference2009/program/session-selector/

There is no conflict between the three BDI sessions. The session description on

http://www.tdwg.org/conference2009/program/working-sessions/

is a bit brief and outdated, but we have no means to update it. Thus,
for the BDI II and III sessions (14:30-17:00 on Tuesday) we have an
internal planning page:

http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/BDIWorkingGroupSession2009

This list includes the "Visual and textual standards for taxonomic
identification" session, We (Hagedorn, Grard, Bonnet)  organize the
two sessions together. Contributions to the planning and proposals for
further topics are welcome.

Here is a preliminary agenda for the SPM I working session at TDWG on
Tuesday, 1100-1230:
http://bit.ly/37ZFiO

I am in the process of recruiting relevant people to lead some of
these discussion items. Please feel free to volunteer. I'm especially
wondering if anybody has experience taking a TDWG standard through the
ratification process, as we will need your guidance.

If you plan to attend and want to add something to the agenda, please
email me. If you have any background material relevant to the
discussion items, you are invited to add it yourself to the wiki
whether you will be attending the session or not. Also, feel free to
start discussion on this mailing list before the session.

I will be adding to the background material over the next couple of
days and will bring hard copies to the session. Even if you don't have
a chance to review it in advance, you are welcome to attend the
session. We have more than 30 people who have expressed interest so it
should be a lively hour and a half!

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-spm,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-spm into tdwg-content. The list tdwg-spm will be =
closed and removed once the archives have been merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=
