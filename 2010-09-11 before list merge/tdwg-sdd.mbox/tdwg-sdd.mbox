Gregor asks:

Short answer: yes they would be useful for some purposes, but horribly
limiting for others.

Long answer: this is a complicated question, and depends to some extent on
your philosophical position and vision of the future!

Again, I think it's important to keep in mind that there are two broad
uses/classes of described characteristics in good descriptions/keys.
"Comparative" characters are the sort that we all aim to record in standard
fashion for all taxa in a group/treatment - with respect to shape, this
would be "leaves ovate", "leaves elliptic" etc. "Discriminative" characters
are much more specific, and are used to discriminate two or more closely
similar taxa, or to describe a distinctive and unique (hence usefully
discriminative) feature of a taxon. Examples of these:

Leaves subspirally twisted and often undulate with a spreading incurved or
recurved acuminate apex .............Andersonia latiflora
vs
Leaves not twisted or undulate, apex triquetrous or more or less cylindric,
mucronate............................Andersonia aristata

and the following description of Acacia horridula "leaves":

Phyllodes crowded, narrowly semitrullate, broadest below the middle at the
slight gland-tipped angle

(both examples are from the Flora of the Perth Region. If I'd looked harder
I could have found wackier examples - Nepenthes would be a good place to look).

These shapes can't be adequately described in words, let alone using the
IAPT shapes, and I'm damn sure they wouldn't be adequately covered in any
agreed lexicon of shape terms.

And smell! There are two species of Caladenia (Orchidaceae) in Victoria that
are best discriminated by smell - one smells like a wet cat, the other like
a dry one!

The philosophical thing is that modern systematics is moving towards a
position of decrying any description that's not fully comparative - the
whole idea behind DELTA, for instance, is to produce fully comparative,
complete descriptions and we tell our undergraduates to avoid at all costs
describing some feature for one taxon in a monograph and then not mentioning
it for others. The outcome of this is a trend towards the bland, generalised
description that, while fully comparable with all other descriptions, fails
to get across the essence of the thing (and of course, computer-generated
descriptions are the blandest of all).

There will always be a tension between these two aspects of a description.
I'd suggest that the reason that the fully comparative description, and with
it the idea of lexical lists, is becoming so seductive is because we
increasingly represent the world the way it can be represented in computers
and databases - we're adapting to the machine rather than vice versa.

Sorry about the diatribe.

Cheers - k

<offtopic>
Character numbers can't be declared as ID if you want to use numbers.
The value of ID attributes has to match the Name production in
the XML spec.

Take the following document:

<!DOCTYPE bar [
<!ELEMENT bar EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST bar attrib ID #REQUIRED>
]>
<bar attrib="1" />

Run it through RXP:

C:\temp>e:\rxp\rxp -xVS bar.xml
Warning: The attribute attrib of element bar is declared as ID but
contains a token that does not start with a name character in unnamed
entity at line 5 char 16 of file:/C:/temp/bar.xml
<bar attrib="1"></bar>

Besides IDs are fairly useless, Schema based validation will likely hold
more
value.
</offtopic>

I'm hoping at some point to revisit XDELTA, to take a step back and
apply some comments/requirements that have surfaced on this list.
If nothing else it might be a talking point.

I'll ditch traditional DTDs and use a Schema based validation mechanism
instead.

Cheers,

L.

Subject:      XDELTA and LucID
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dear Leigh,

I've been looking through your XDELTA DTD. The group has already commented
that it's "merely" a literal mapping of DELTA, but it's a very useful start :-)

LucID can do a number of things that DELTA can't, and perhaps XDELTA as it
stands can't either. You should consider these (quotes are from your
xdelta.dtd document):

(forgive me if I've misinterpreted some things in the DTD - I'm new to these
things)

1. Character groups

><!-- A character group allows the grouping of related characters together.
DELTA does
>     not enforce the grouping of characters, and neither does XDELTA.
However the
>     CHARACTER HEADINGS directive seems to assume that related characters
will be
>     grouped together within a DELTA file (as it only specifies the first
character
>     that falls under each heading). XDELTA therefore allows characters to
be grouped
>     in this way.

I assume that character groups here are equivalent to character sets in
LucID - groupings of characters so that you can e.g. display only leaf
characters in a random-access key. In LucID there is no requirement that
characters in a set are consecutive in the character list. Further, any
character may belong to more than one set - this is very useful so that e.g.
you can have the sets "leaves", "flowers", "petals", "simple" in which
"petal" characters also belong to the "flowers" set, and the "simple" set
comprises a selection of characters from all the other sets.

2. Character state notes

DELTA stores all notes as plain text, sometimes marked up with its own
typesetting marks, but pretty plain nonetheless. LucID allows builders of
keys to associate a formatted file (txt, rtf, html) with a character state,
to hold explanatory notes. One option would be to include xml markup as
comment (would this be messy if the notes included embedded images, hotlinks
etc). Another would be to treat state notes as you do images, with an href
pointer to a file. LucID also allows sound files to be associated with a
state (imagine a key to cicadas or frogs with calls as characters).

3. Taxon multimedia

LucID allows any number of multimedia files (images, videos, sounds, txt,
rtf, html) files to be associated with a taxon. Each file has a title for
display in a drop down menu. e.g. the taxon "Polygalaceae" may have notes
files "Brief Description", "Full Description", "List of genera", "Ecology"
etc., images "Polygala japonica (habit)", "Polygala japonica (detail of
flower)", "Comesperma volubile", sound file "The wind blowing through leaves
of Polygala minuta" etc.

We store all these as separate files for the convenience of the builder and
speed of retrieval. I can see that for the notes it would perhaps be
possible to store everything in one xml file or block and use a style sheet
to give different views, but this may be awkward and limiting.

4. Images

<!-- An image. An image can have associated text (e.g. a title).

It's useful to allow an image to have both a title and associated text e.g.
notes, credits, copyright notice. Defining the title separately from the
text allows an application to retrieve and display just this without the rest.

5. Character values

LucID allows a richer assignation of character state values to taxa. Thus, a
taxon may be scored as having state 1 as its normal state, state 2 rarely,
state 3 by misinterpretation, and be unknown for state 4. The full list is:

normally present
rarely present
uncertain
present by misinterpretation
rarely present by misinterpretation

These are important. Note that the proposed extensions to DELTA incorporate
some or all of these. Gregor has already proposed a system of modifiers to
allow this.

6. Taxon subkeys

In LucID keys one key may be linked as a child to another. A taxon thus has
the name of a subkey associated with it, so that a user on reaching the
taxon can ask the program to automatically drop to the subkey to continue
the identification.

Note that if the promise of a universal lexicon fails to materialize, we'll
need a way of mapping characters from one key to another, so that characters
can be passed from the parent key to the child.

7. A small point:

>     A multistate character must contain at least one state.

Surely a multistate character must contain at least two states.

8. General Information

Not all information in a key or other treatment can be associated with
character states or taxa. Some is associated with the treatment as a whole
e.g. introductory notes, notes on using the key, general notes for the
parent taxon of the key (e.g. a key to genera of Grossulariaceae may have a
description of the family) etc. In LucID this information may comprise html
files, images etc just as with taxa and states. This could be easily dealt
with by expanding your DTD. A special case is an "About this key" file. This
needs much more than is allowed in the document description:

-->
<!ELEMENT xdelta (description?, character-list?, item-list?)>
<!ATTLIST xdelta revised        CDATA #IMPLIED>

9. Collaborative projects

>TODO - its feasible that documents may grow quite lengthy with

It will sometimes happen that several collaborators will share a common
character list and score different taxa, as you describe. But it will also
happen that the collaborators share a taxon list and score different
characters. This may be simple, but the same issues (interdocument
references, conflicts etc) need to be addressed.

Yes you've interpreted correctly, and XDELTA is limited in that
characters can only be within a single group, and must be grouped
together.

This did concern me when I was initially writing the DTD, but based on
the fact that DELTA had the same limitation I thought it would be good
enough for a first cut. LucID is obviously more flexible.

How about if the text allowed (X)HTML markup to me used. This would
allow the full range of HTML expression (tables, bold, images, etc).
However it would mean tht processors (e.g. a stylesheet) would need to
understand HTML. I suggest that a subset of the available markup
would be enough in most cases. A pointer to additional document(s)
would also be useful.

> 3. Taxon multimedia
>

Ideally an XML format would allow this as well. A generic 'link' to
additional information could be used. It then depends on the application
to decide whether it can fetch, and handle the particular
multimedia format.

More generally I think that (from other comments on the list), it would
be useful to attach this kind of information : notes, credit, copyright,
origin, etc in multiple places in the format - including textual
descriptions.

This sounds like a strong requirement then.

If I understand this correctly you mean that the subkey provides additional
information regarding the taxon. To take a trivial example, the first
key may identify a plant to the Family level, whilst the subkey had
additional information - e.g. to the species?

If so, then this is related to the document linking problem below...

Yes, You're quite right! :)

This is one area that I don't think we've touched upon to a great extent
(I could be wrong). Heres a question:

- is it enough to just have an 'additional information' element
so that any required explanatory notes, etc can be added there.

Heres my answer (and I'd welcome comment):

No its not. It would be useful to try to quantify this additional
information,
so that a generic catch-all placeholder isn't used. This sidesteps issues
such as that shown by the comment marker in DELTA which ends up being
used for all sorts of other uses. Its this kind of information which is
highly useful both to the user, and the application developer: the user
has a defined place to add his/her information, the developer has explicit
cues on how particular sections of information should be used.

So to start a running list:
        - introduction
        - about this key?
        - parent taxon / related keys
        - usage guidelines
        - other meta information?
                (see above - copyright, funding body, author, change history, etc).

Anything else?

I'd hadn't thought of this - its the reverse of what I'd originally
expected.

I expect the referencing and conflict resolution mechanism to be
tricky to solve, and I'm hoping we can delay some of those decisions
until such time as a document structure has been determined - mainly
because not all the issues will be obvious until that point.

------------------------------

You've commented that you're just getting to grips with DTDs, is
it going to cause a great problem if I design the next version of
XDELTA using XML Schemas [1,2]? Schemas provide a great deal more
flexibility
when defining document structures, as well as validation (not
that I expect the latter issue to matter to a huge degree in this
context). The are some structures in the XDELTA DTD which I'm not
particularly happy with, but are imposed by the limitations of
DTD syntax. I'm hoping that Schemas will remove some of these constraints.

When I get chance to attempt another iteration of XDELTA (hopefully
quite shortly), I can fully document the Schema to bring people
up to speed - i.e. use XDELTA as a tutorial piece.

As an aside - if anyone wishes additional explanation of the current
DTD then I'm more than happy to oblige.

I also don't want to appear to be leading everyone by the nose
towards an XML based format, or one which I've produced myself.
So please consider XDELTA, as I've always maintained, as a discussion
point.

>From a strictly practical point of view, multistate characters must be

After collecting data from one, or just a few taxa, you may only have a
single character state known.  As the research progresses, additional
character states will be discovered and added to the character list.  In
the preliminary stages of any taxonomic study the number of known
character states is usually very low, and must be allowed for!

When I first started using DELTA, my character list was peppared with "2.
FILLER/" so that I could get characters onto the character list.  Some
years back, Mike changed the DELTA software so that it will now accept a
multistate character with a single state.

My major concern with this process and its discussions is that the results
will be something that works and is practical.  The most computionally
perfect system may well turn out to be impractical and unworkable.  Some
years ago, I pointed out to someone that his program did not work because
my numerical data for one character, "1.5-2/3.5-7.8", could not be input
into his software because it would only accept "1.5-7.8".  I sincerely
hope that it is kept firmly in mind that the results have to work in the
real world, not the ideal world.

Yes, I think we'd need to allow for both - embedded (X)HTML and pointers to
external documents, from which an application could fetch stuff if
necessary. I have a key with 800 states each with html notes, images etc.
Embedding all this would make for one hell of a document.

Yes it's a linking issue. By allowing links from one document to another you
can build hierarchies of documents e.g. I have a key to Families of
Flowering Plants of Australia: the family Solanaceae has a link to a
separate key to genera and species of that family, and some of these taxa
have further subkey links. The hierarchy of keys-subkeys is being built up
in an ad hoc fashion.

I wouldn't like to try to force people into boxes here. It may be that there
are some "General Info" topics that are fairly common, but you can't predict
how someone will want to structure this. For instance, someone writing a key
to insects might want to have a topic covering collecting techniques,
another would want general info on biological control. A user here who has
published a key to eucalypts of Australia has included a synoptic
classification.

Best option again I think would be to be very general and allow flexible
links to external files with topic names.

I agree it's still a discussion point but it's the best we have so far to
start bringing this discussion towards a product, doing which will bring out
extra points, flaws, limitations etc. If you're willing to do the work on
it, then I'm sure we're willing to comment and pick the holes.

I couldn't agree more. But we also need to use this process to move ahead.
And we need to make sure that the taxonomists on the list keep an eagle eye
on the computer jocks to make sure they don't go off to Saturn.

Question for XMLHeads - can an XML DTD refer to a remote XML document as a
resource?

If it can, could we solve the lexicon problem (which is, that some people
like the idea of a lexicon and others don't) like this?

A lexicographer puts onto the web an XML resource that provides a
character/state list for a given universe of interest (seed plants/all
life/the flagellated sporozoans of deepsea hydrothermal vents, whatever). If
other workers like the character list and think they can live with it, then
they include a URL to the lexicon in their document, and the lexicon is used
as their character list. But if no available lexicon works for a given user,
then they can define their own character list. That way, perhaps we'll all
be happy.

If this model works, it could perhaps also allow for extensibility ie mixed
lists comprising remote lexica and extra document-defined characters.

A problem with such lexica would be data security - what would happen if the
lexicon's server crashes permanently - and how to allow for evolving lexica
without invalidating previous treatments.

Any good?

Judging by the example you outline below I believe you want to link
together two XML documents, rather than a DTD and a document. The latter
doesn't bring any benefits in this case...

This is exactly the sort of thing I was hoping would happen. The advantage
being,
that character and item information are separated. Therefore a character
list
can be reused, either between groups (across the web, departments,
whatever),
or reused by the same researcher when producing a new taxonomy.

<aside>
I debated this structure in XDELTA, but plumbed for a single file comprising
all information. I think I commented on this somewhere in the DTD.

In my second iteration I'm going to split them into two files - actually
I'm thinking that a modular approach may be useful : define a module for
expressing
character/state information and a module for expressing item information.
I've tentatively identified a third module which comprising textual
markup, links to additional resources, etc.

Breaking the problem down into 3 sections should make tackling it a lot
easier. The schema itself can then be modular as well.
</aside>

There is a standard for document linking - XLink - which allows
two documents to be linked, and even portions of a document to be
selected. So we should be able to use this kind of feature
quite easily:

e.g. <characters import="http://www.foo.org/characters.xml" />
or   <characters import="c://my-project/characters.xml" />

(note these are not XLinks, I don't have the spec to hand for
a clear example)

Yes.

There are a number of issues:

- how are character lists imported if a computer is not connected to
the net?
- what happens if a server is not available?
- how are multiple imported character lists merged - which takes
precedence (local or remote)
- versioning of character lists
- what if a remote character list is (or becomes) invalid (related
to versioning)
- how are a item list, and its associated character list (and any
additional supporting files) packaged together for either delivery
across the internet, or on traditional media like CDs.

The good news is that these issues are not isolated to this
particular problem and we can benefit from solutions defined
elsewhere.

I think so!

There's a short answer, a long answer, and a quibble about this first
question. Like most quibbles, the quibble is the longest.

The short answer is: Yes, this is routinely done.

The long answer: There's little point in putting the long answer into
this group.

The quibble: As Leigh and others have suggested, there is substantial
motivation to specify data structuring in XML-Schema instead of the
older DTD formalisms, even if the result is then translated into a DTD
so that more of current tools can use it. This is especially true
here, because the mechanisms for importing definitions are less clunky
in Schema than in DTD (largely because DTD arises from SGML, which
predates the web by 20 years).

If nothing else, the vocabulary of Schema allows more definitive
descriptions of data types and so forms a better reference standard
than a DTD. Although I count myself more an XMLTongue or XMLNose, I
think it fair to say that the XMLHeads are probably thinking: "whenever
the TaxonHead's say DTD, we should privately understand Schema"

This is pretty much one of the things that XML is designed to make
feasible.

Definition evolution and resource location problems are so pervasive
that they are an important part of the XML specifiers' work (and that
of W3C in general). FWIW it's not that hard to make an application use
a local copy of a resource if it can't find the network copy.

Backward compatibility of course rests not so much on mechanisms
enabling it as with the authors actually accomplishing it. The task is
fraught with the risk of thinkos. (A thinko is to your brain as a typo
is to your fingers. The term was coined by David Fuchs, one of the
architects of FrameMaker and before that an implementor at Stanford of
the portable version of TeX, which had originally been written in the
SAIL language and only ran to a handful of PDP-10's.)

It was already said that we need a local copy. I think this is quite
natural especially because I believe we will have proprietary
database formats the most applications will work on, and not directly
XML.

> - how are multiple imported character lists merged - which takes

We need to be able to combine both character definition and item
description in a way that some characters may go across multiple item
subsets but also some character used only in certain items. If items
are then reduced to the level of taxa in a summarize/synthesize
operation, even more complex structures can result.

> - versioning of character lists

Of course, with major versions in which meaning is changed, minor
version in which only corrections and additions are made, and perhaps
subminor with corrections only.

> - what if a remote character list is (or becomes) invalid (related
> to versioning)

Globally unique state IDS may consist of a local ID (not the sequence
number), the name and version of the standard.

I believe the merging, updating, controlling business of versioned
character definition standards is one of the main things why we need
more structure in the character definition (see basic property
discussion etc.).

---

I believe we need:

Globally unique IDs for _states_ (perhaps for character and headings
as well, not sure). The ID should be independend of ID numbers like
in DELTA and DeltaAccess, that are simultaneously ordering numbers.

A local copy that refers to a published standard. I believe it would
be good if the future standard allows manual links e.g. to a standard
published in print.

I imagine an attribute in which the author of a character definition
acertains that in his or her opinion the meaning of this data item is
identical to a standard, even if the wording may have been slightly
changed.

The problem is that ANY character definition standard needs to be
partly changed locally. Certain attributes of the character
definition, esp. those that are language specific (character and
state wordings, including character and state specific number and
date formats) or refer to formatting and structuring (ParagraphLink,
SentenceLink, CommaLink for natural language, Sequential ordering
numbers, Heading, etc.) are highly likely to be in need for change.

It may be desirable to split the character definition into a logical
part, changes of which imply changes of contents, and a formatting
part, which is always used as template only, and can be freely
changed.

(This implies that the character name needs to be doubled/split into
a global development name, probably in English, and a name that is
displayed in local language on the user interface.)

Dear subscribers to TDWG

I've been 'listening' to the contributions on Lexicons, XML etc. for a while
now and thought I should seek your comments because your contributions have
sparked several developments in my thinking. I'm wrestling with the
development of a hierarchy (containment hierarchies) of systematic
descriptors for corn/maize/ Zea mays for the Missouri Maize Project (see
URLs below). While this is challenging for maize/corn on its own, an added
challenge is my desire to develop containment hierarchies which are
compatible with databases for other grass crops e.g. rice (Oryza). To add to
the challenge I have the ideal of trying to accommodate the 'interests' of
similar databases for various DICOT crops e.g. soybean, cotton. While I do
appreciate that such an all encompassing approach is maybe impossible to
achieve I thought that it would still be good to get some other folks
opinions on this. Having some kind of 'generic' structure which accommodates
monocots & dicots should greatly facilitate the interoperability of these
databases. It's the interoperability scenario which really got me on to
thinking about this issue. Conducting simultaneous searches of dicot &
monocot databases for morphological data down to molecular (e.g. sequence)
data is not too far fetched. But I'm battling to find info. which
addresses/refers to such 'generic' standards.

I'd be grateful to have your thoughts on the above.

Sincerely,

When one starts to "spread" morphological databases in botany one runs into
innumerable problems, as I think I mentioned some time ago.  In this case,
thinking of monocots and "dicots", will we allow monocots to have stipules?
What do we do with the intravaginal squamules of many Alismatales which, as
far as I can see, are colleters under another name?  But why should they
not have a different name, since they are likely of independent origin from
colleters in dicots?  But, if one takes that tack, can we use the terms
haplostemony and diplostemony in monocots, as Ronse Decraene questioned in
a monocot symposium volume about four years ago?  Indeed, do monocots ever
have sepals or petals?  Why should "hypogeal" and "epigeal" mean different
things for monocot and dicot seedlings?

These are not insoluble problems, but I have seen no recent discussions on
how to clarify botanical terminology, although I think that this is
definitely needed - and it needs to be an international effort, not least
because we can have the same botanical term meaning different things in
different languages (I think "crassinucellate" is an example).

Dear subscribers to TDWG-SDD

On Jan. 31, 2000 I sent an email to you (copy below) about developing a
containment hierarchy for Maize & expanding this to include the rest of the
Poaceae and hopefully subsequently the rest of the monocots & dicots (via
interoperable ontologies).

I'm presenting some of this work at the next Maize Genetics Conference
(March) [http://www.agron.missouri.edu/Coop/Conf/2000.html] & include a copy
of the abstract below F.Y.I.

--------------
Conference abstract:

Developing systematic descriptors and containment hierarchies for maize

The Systematic Descriptors component of the Missouri Maize Project is aiming
to provide descriptors in appropriate 'containment hierarchies' (biological
terms, their relationships and associations) for maize. We wish to design a
structure that has wide contribution from scientists studying maize and many
other plant species. Databases comprising all sorts of information on
monocots and dicots will need to be increasingly interoperable to facilitate
future concurrent searches of these databases and so be helpful to a wide
range of end-users. Developing systematic descriptors in containment
hierarchies which accommodate maize data is a challenge on its own. But
developing a structure that can accommodate present and future data from
other monocot and dicot taxa, is another very relevant and stimulating
challenge. An overview has been developed and the framework is forming. We
are seeking feedback on the framework and content. NSF award 9872655.
-----------------------

For further info. on this project please access:
http://www.agron.missouri.edu/mnl/74/89vincent.html - a publication in the
Maize News Letter.


Should you have any comments, suggestions... about the development of
containment hierarchies for maize (in a formal ontology) and the subsequent
development of interoperable ontologies, I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,
- Leszek Vincent

1.  XHTML:  Bridging the Gap between HTML and XML
    (Kynn Bartlett, HWG President, kynn@hwg.org)

On 26 January 2000, the World Wide Web Consortium released the newest
flavor of HTML -- XHTML.  The HTML Writers Guild is proud to have
played a role in the development of this specification, and we would
like to thank Ann Navarro and Frank Boumphrey for their dedication and
hard work in the W3C's HTML Working Group.

But what _is_ XHTML, and what does it mean to members of the Guild?

WHAT IS XHTML?

To understand that, first we need to review what HTML is.  Hypertext
Markup Language was created as an "application" of SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language), which is a "meta-language" for describing
other markup languages.

Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is simply a version of
HTML but defined as an application of XML (Extensible Markup Language).
XML was developed as another "meta-language", not as complex as SGML
but powerful enough for use in web environments.

WHY XHTML?

Why an XML-based HTML, if we already have "normal" HTML?  By using
XHTML, we have access to the strengths of XML -- extensibility and
interoperability.  Developers can extend XHTML through modules, DTDs,
schemas, and incorporation of other XML-based languages.  XSLT
(Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations), which allow XML
documents to be easily changed from one representation to another,
will make it easy to adapt XHTML pages for a wide variety of browsers
and user agents.

WHAT IS XHTML LIKE?

If you're already familiar with HTML 4.01, you'll find that XHTML
1.0 offers the same features and abilities you've always had.  (Future
versions of XHTML will expand beyond simply "translating" the HTML
specification into XML.)

There are some differences in syntax, however; the most notable ones
include:

    * Documents must be "well formed" -- an XML term meaning that
      tags must match and be nested properly
    * Element and attribute names must be in lower case
    * For non-empty elements, end tags are required -- no more
      optional </P> or </LI> tags
    * Attribute values must always be enclosed in quotes
    * Empty elements must either have an end tag, or the start tag
      must end with />

If you're like at least half of the web designers out there, the
second bullet point above might stand out and you may be asking:

WHY LOWER CASE?

In HTML, tags and attributes are not case sensitive.  This means
that <BODY>, <body>, <Body>, and even <bOdY> refer to the same thing;
you can have your opening tag be <body> and your closing tag </BODY>,
and it all works fine.

XML, the language used to build XHTML, is case sensitive.  <Body>
is considered a different tag from <BODY>, <body>, or <bOdY>, in XML.

Because of this, a standard for XHTML tags had to be set -- and the
most likely choices were "all uppercase" (such as <BODY>), or "all
lowercase" (such as <body>).  In the end, lowercase won out, although
it really could have gone either way; a semi-arbitrary choice had to
be made.

DO CURRENT BROWSERS SUPPORT XHTML?

No and yes.  Current browser releases do not speak XHTML, they speak
HTML.  However, it is possible to write XHTML in a way that is
compatible with HTML, and will not break on existing HTML-based
browsers.  These are described in Appendix C of the XHTML specification.

As an example, the "hr" (horizontal rule) tag must be closed, and
would normally be written in XHTML as either <hr/> or <hr></hr>.
However, this will confuse many existing HTML-based browsers; instead,
you can write the tag as <hr /> -- note the space.  This is legitimate
XHTML and is compatible with HTML browsers.

HOW CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT XHTML?

The complete spec for XHTML 1.0 is available via the web from the W3C's
web site:

     http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/

For a chance to experience XHTML and XML first-hand -- or perhaps just
view the source of some web pages written in XHTML -- read on to the
next article!

Dear list_eners

attached find SDDspecs.rtf. This is my attempt to formalise the discussion
so far into a set of specifications for a new descriptive data standard.

Leigh has explained that his XDELTA is a first-cut approach to such a
standard, done more to show what's possible than as a serious suggestion for
a final cut. He has offered to revisit and rework "XDELTA" in light of the
list's discussions.

To make his job easier, I think it wold be a good idea for those of us still
out there to work up a structured specification document for Leigh to work
his magic on. If it works OK, the attached may be the first step to this
specification.

Again, this is a first cut. It incorporates my ideas, and those I've been
able to trawl from the list that have made sense to me. I may have got
things all wrong, and it will almost certainly not be exhaustive, but I
think at this stage it's better for the authors of other ideas to work on
this directly rather than for me to try to understand what they were saying.

I hope the document's self-explanatory - if not, ask me to explain.

Any suggestions as to the best way to work up the document? If we all edit
bits and repost we'll end up with diverging versions.

Anyway, see if this makes sense to you.

Cheers - k

I'm not competent to address the proposal, but I would like
to try to influence the directions that may emerge from it in
several ways:

(a).On theoretical and practical grounds, DTD's
are now understood to be a weak way to describe the schemata
(small 'S') of XML documents. The specialists should argue
about whether RDF or XML-Schema's (uppercase 'S') work
better (or try each on for size) and if there is a compelling
reason to have a DTD then derive one from the Schema. Aside
from (or perhaps actually because of) the lack of typing,
inheritance, and ordering mechanisms, DTDs add restrictions
on the kinds of schema inference that can be made from
particular XML documents that might be a query result, and
because of that make it less straightforward to mediate
between the answers to queries on two different databases.
These issues are explored in the book "Data on the Web" by
Abitoul et al., and in the literature behind it.

(b). Mixed content (a mixture of text and elements) is a really
bad idea, as is well known in the SGML community. Our own
limited experience has been that dealing with it in display code
necessitates to code obscurely. I can't tell whether anything
in the proposal would lead this way. Maybe some pseudo-code
XML-like examples would enlighten.

(c). One should keep in mind that queries can be constructed
by software, not just by people. The latter are far better than
the former at resolving ambiguity and supplying reasonable
defaults. So for example, we should always ask at the end if
we have given enough to formulate queries and interpret their
answers in a non-interactive fashion.

Put another way, data exchange is a minor reason to
adopt XML compared to its utility for the construction of
queries and the interpretation of their answers. (Here's a trivial
example, soon to be easily fixed: the data returned by the
experimental XML facility at ITIS*ca conforms to a DTD in all
but one case: that where there is no data matching the query.
In that case, it returns the same HTML "sorry no answer"
page that the html interface does, thereby requiring an XML
application to have special knowledge of this case---which
would not bother a human at all but sure startled our
little application.)

and requested comments his proposal. I've not had time to think this
through in detail, but I'd nonetheless like to offer a few scattered
observations.

1) One "pattern" that recurs in the document in the use of "attachments" to
entities. These consist of a name, type, path, public notes, and private
notes. Presumably one could define some sort of generic "attachment" object
and avoid the multiple (4) redefinitions currently given in the outline.
This would shorten the outline appreciably.

2) ID numbers crop up in a number of places. But it's not obvious how
"unique" these various IDs need to be. For example, must character IDs be
unique only with the context of the set of all character IDs, or of all IDs
used anywhere within the treatment? Or perhaps they are intended be used
across treatments (to facilitate merging, etc.), and must be unique (but
consistent) in an even broader sense? (But perhaps this is an area this is
best left deliberately ambiguous for now.)

3) Character (and taxon) sets - these should probably be defined
hierarchically, so that sets would be able contain other sets, as well as
the base elements (characters or taxa). Note that there seems to be another
"up vs. down" problem here - is it better to define a set by listing the
members within it, or for the each of the members to list the sets to which
it belongs?

4) I'm rather confused by footnote 3, regarding the nesting of character
names, and the restriction of "properties" to only the lowest level. What
it the reason for this restriction? But certainly there seems to be merit
in separating the "properties" of a character from it's textual
representation. This is almost essential when attempting to generate
natural-language descriptions in multiple languages. Similarly, different
wordings may be appropriate in different application contexts
(natural-language vs. interactive keys vs. conventional keys, or keys of
the layman vs. the specialist).

5) This draft allows for a "score" only within the context of a "state
name". It is not obvious how characters with non-discrete values (e.g.
numeric values) would be handled.

6) I'm intrigued by the notion of a "Progressive Revelation model"
(footnote 5). It sounds terribly theological - or perhaps that's
Thiele-logical? (my apologies to Kevin, but I really can't resist bad puns).

7) For purposes of natural-language generation (and perhaps other
applications), it is desirable to have some sort of "connection operator"
between states within a character (e.g., "flowers blue or violet" vs.
"flowers blue and violet" vs. "flowers blue to violet" all carry slightly
different meanings). This and other requirements of generating
natural-language descriptions might be an argument for generally preferring
a "characters within taxa" representation to "taxa within characters".

Hi,

Just to respond to the following mentioned by Bob:

Mixed content can certainly be difficult to manage, although
people are using it on a daily basis when they write HTML,
so it can't all be bad!

Seriously though, I had been thinking that the 'notes'
and other free text sections in the format would use XHTML
derived tags to describe its presentation. Perhaps its
worth exploring this further.

Firstly, for non-markup people. Mixed content is markup
which contains free text interspersed with additional tags.

e.g. <notes>This is <b>mixed</b> content</notes>

An (trivial) example using XDELTA syntax:

<character number="2">
   <description>main colour of inner part of front wing</description>
   <image num="2" mime="image/jpeg" href="lepc02.jpg" />
   <multi type="unordered">
        ...states removed...
   </multi>
   <notes>I should stress here that there <em>may be</em>
other wings colours yet to be determined</notes>
</character>

Where <em> denotes emphasised text.

This facilitates the production of a nicely formatted display,
at least for HTML.

An alternative which removes mixed content (I'll just
reproduce the notes tag for clarity:

<notes>
<text>I should stress here that there </text>
<em>may be</em>
<text>other wings colours yet to be determined</text>
</notes>

I believe this is less readable, and involves more markup effort
from the user.

Of course I might be barking up the wrong tree, and this
kind of markup isn't a requirement.

The issue is related to how the textual content in the data
is to be presented to the user, and isn't something we've
explored yet.

The main problem with mixed content is it makes life difficult
for parser and tool writers. It does make some things easier
for the user, like readability.

Cheers,

L.

I agree, and will use the W3C XML-Schema syntax to produce
an XML interpretation of Kevins document. I'll refrain
from using any complicated Schema features so at to
not detract from the core discussion.

The debate in the developer community concerning Schemas
is currently something of a hot topic [1].

I hope to be able to present something shortly.

Cheers,

L.

Yes and yes; DTD is an old technology from SGML, if we want a standard
for at least 10 years, it's better to avoid it.

Dear contributors

It's good to see a new debate begining!


Undefined terms in SDD Specifications Document:

   * "Progressive Revelation model"
   * Treatment
   * score

It seems that this Specification mixes data and Specification of processing to
be done on this data by an application. Processing is a very interesting subject
(see transforms), but good design is layered design, and processing seems an
upper and distinct layer.

Hi,

> The spring is coming, the crocuses are in bloom, it's time to come up
> with a formal model.

Some questions:

1. Firstly is it possible to express items like

"Feature often present by mis-identification"
(I came across this somewhere, but can't recall the posting/webpage)

I note you've already highlighted seasonal variations as a problem.
To that I'd add geographical, and developmental (i.e. age of
item).

2. It seems to presuppose a Linnean viewpoint i.e. Kingdom,
Phylum, etc. Gregor has previously pointed out that the
reality is much more complex. Multiple hierarchies
can be produced. For example, how would the model be used to express
DNA/Protein data? Physiological versus Molecular hierarchies?

[See (RQT) Character and item hierarchy from Gregor
posted on 1/12/99 - I'd include a URL, but the ListServ archive
seems to require a username/password]

3. I assume that the list of Feature/Properties will not be
fixed, but can be extended at will?

Apologies if this seems overly critical, I'm just trying to get
my head around things.

Fundamentally I think that an RDF (or even Groves) model of
the data will be extremely useful. However I'm concerned that
the presence of items like 'TaxonomicClass' in the model doesn't
capture the range of flexibility that Kevin, Gregor and the others
have stated as a requirement.

I'd welcome some further discussion/information of your model.

Cheers,

L.

My solution: the default for a Property is to record the state for:
- middle of active season
- adult specimen

Otherwise, create a new Property. Note that beside the specified
sub-elements of tax:Property (appliesTo, appliesToClasses, name), it is
possible to add extra information like, say,
<bio:season>spring</bio:season>. This is a property (rdf:Property) about a
property (tax:Property).

This is puzzling.  In that case why would a TaxonomicClass need to have a
member named "botanicalAuthor" as in your UML diagram?

I was also curious about this notion. Maybe it is one of the latest
"revelations" of Religious Cladism - its practitioners are fond of such
theological terminology.

Otherwise, I essentially agree with all the points raised by Eric Z.

I was about to suggest that a graphic model, perhaps using the UML
methodology, was in order, but Jean-Marc Vanel has already taken care of
that. His model is interesting, and deserves attention.

Mauro, are you serious, or was this just a through-away comment? This is the

"Religious Cladism" means what, and
"its practitioners" refers to whom?

Bob Morris

surely something like this - working out data requirements - needs to be
done whether the final product has a DTD, RDF or XML-Schema base.

I'm not qualified to argue the implications or advantages, so how about
those of us like me argue about the data, and you mob argue about the rest.
Maybe we can get to resolutions at the same time!

This sounds sensible. Should someone edit the document to reflect this, or
should we just leave efficiency dividends like this to Leigh or whoever
creates the final thing?

Two comments though. Firstly, most of these attachment objects will be
unique - presumably it won't often happen that one attachment will be used
for two taxa, or for a taxon and a character state. So do you gain much?

Secondly, ease of reading the text treatment should be a consideration. If
all the information re the attachment stays with the taxon/state etc entry,
this may make the treatment more navigable.

I'd say that IDs need to be unique within their context eg at the character
level. Super-uniqueness beyond the treatment is the lexicon issue and
doesn't need to be addressed here, I think. We should construct the standard
in such a way that lexica can grow, but without a requirement for them. For
instance, there should be no requirement that character IDs form a
contiguous integer set.

What do people think?

Does the idea of allowing nested sets overlap and merge the boundary with
the nested character structure, and perhaps become redundant. For instance,
I envisage the characters being nested (as discussed earlier in the list):

Plant
 leaves
  orientation
  venation
   prominence
   reticulation
 flowers
  petals
   colour
   number
.........etc

Sets are perhaps a shortcut across all this. If they were heirarchically
structured, would you just be repeating much of the above without the lowest
level?

There are many things in the document that I haven't thought through
properly, but I decided to get it out for comment before labouring further.

I think what I meant was that the higher-level structures in the character
names list do not have any representation in the data "matrix", only the
lowest level.
Consider some data represented in the LucID way (as a taxon-state matrix)
(you can do the same thing for a DELTA representation in which cells of the
matrix hold taxon-character scores):

       123456789
Taxon1 010101000
Taxon2 111010101
Taxon3 000101001

Columns 1-9 represent character states. Columns 1-3 may be the states of
character 1, 4-5 the states of character 2, 6-9 the states of character 3.
Now characters 1&2 may both belong to a higher-level structure, but the
properties of this higher-level thing are not equivalent to the properties
of the state (for instance, it can't have a score).

But perhaps there are properties in common?

>5) This draft allows for a "score" only within the context of a "state

Just as for Leigh's original XDELTA.

Again, I think Leigh's XDELTA covers this, using nested scores.

I'm often accused of teleology, but rarely of theology.

Progressive Revelation is perhaps a new way of handling holes in data
matrices for random-access keys. The background is this:

The simplest data structure for a random-access key is a fully populated
matrix i.e. all taxa are scored for all characters/states. Works well
sometimes, especially if the taxa are highly comparable e.g. the species of
a genus or the genera of a family.

This structure is problematic sometimes though, for two reasons. Firstly and
most simply, you may not have data for all taxa, and need to leave holes in
the matrix. Solution is simple - fill the holes with ?s and allow for this
in the key program. But it often also happens that some characters are
simply inapplicable to some taxa, or (worse) are non-ambiguous for some taxa
but ambiguous for others. For instance, stipules don't occur in monocots,
stipule-like structures sometimes do but if you try scoring stipule
characters as defined for dicots against monocots you run into all sorts of
strife because of ambiguity of context. LucID can handle this to some extent
using the "present by misinterpretation" score, but the problem is in the
character definition, not the score.

Sometimes a better way to handle such circumstances using LucID is to break
the key up into a hierarchically nested set of keys & subkeys. For instance,
you want to create a key to grass species of Australia but there are many
special characters needed for identifying Poa species that are either
inapplicable to or ambiguous with respect to the remaining grasses. So put
Poa as a genus in the top-level key and attach to it a subkey to Poa species
in which you can optimise your character definitions for the Poas. There are
some disadvantages to this but often the advantages (in having an optimised
rather than generalised and suboptimal character list) outweigh the
disdvantages.

But there may be another solution - Progressive Revelation. As far as I know
no-one's done this yet, but I think it has merit. It would work like this.

Create a key to all grass species so you're working with a list of all taxa
at species level including all the Poa species. The character list has two
classes of characters - ones that are scored over all taxa (these will be
the easily generalised characters) and ones that are scored for only a
subset of taxa (the characters that are highly specific and/or not easily
generalisable). When the key program starts it splashes up the generalised
characters only. But if after answering some characters you end up with only
Poas, the program finds and adds to the character list the Poa-specific
characters. Characters are progressively revealed as you proceed through the
key, with as much depth as necessary - e.g. you may come down to a species
complex of alpine Poas and presto! some characters appear that are just the
ticket to separate them.

Might work.

This seems to me to be a more natural way of approaching both the building
and running of a key. In some ways it's like a hybrid between a traditional
random-access key and a traditional nested hard-copy key, but it has more
flexibility than either.

In the context of natural-language descriptions (and more controversially)
it would also provide a challenge to what to me is the Universalist furphy
that all descriptions should be strictly comparable!

I've included these ideas into the SDD Specification because I think this
may be one for the future.

Cheers - k

ps Eric - if you incorporate these ideas into DELTA we'll need to make an
arrangement regarding due acknowledgement and royalties :-)

Leigh is presumably referring to the "Feature present (by
misinterpretation)" score (see LucID). This is a score applicable to a state
for a taxon so that, for instance, if a taxon lacks petals but has
petal-like pseudopetals, you can score that petals are absent (the truth)
but also present (by misinterpretation). This pre-empts likely user errors
in an interactive key, while allowing the treatment builder to maintain data
integrity. If there is no such score, the only way of pre-empting the
mistake is to deliberately introduce errors into the data.

Something like this, but less rigid, is achieved automatically by algorithms
for finding 'best' characters. A 'best' algorithm typically has a penalty
for characters which are unknown, inapplicable, or variable for some taxa,
but it does not completely exclude them. The 'best' algorithm used in our
programs Intkey (interactive identification) and Key (generation of
conventional keys) has a natural penalty for such characters, arising from
the goal of minimizing the average length of an identification. The
algorithm also has a parameter, Varywt, which can be used to add an
arbitrary penalty for such characters. However, this tends to increase the
average length of an identification, so its use in Intkey is not
recommended. A value of 0 for Varywt would have an effect similar to that
proposed above by Kevin.

If you try this in Intkey, note that a value of 0 is treated as 0.01, an ad
hoc adjustment made specifically to _avoid_ the complete exclusion of the
characters. In a data set with a substantial number of missing or
inapplicable values (e.g. the sample data supplied with the DELTA programs),
it is easy to observe how low values of Varywt cause characters with
comparatively low separating power (and which therefore result in longer
identifications) to move towards the top of the 'best' list.

Varywt is primarily intended for use in Key, where the increased average
length of an identification is offset by a reduction in the _printed_ length
of the key. In Key, a value of 0 completely prevents the use of characters
with intra-taxon variability.

precisely for the reasons you outline below.

[By the way, hoping this is not a forbidden commercialism but at least
reveals my conflict of interest: we operate the university program for
eXcelon, Inc. (formerly Object Design) by which universities can get
Object Store, eXcelon [a native XML store], and most other eXcelon
products for a total of $650/year. See our web site at
www.cs.umb.edu/~serl/odiedu. This is a pretty good way to get into
OODB's if you are a university. The program applies in most of the
world.]

I agree that a graphical representation of the model may be a good idea, but
it's beyond me.

Jean-Marc's work does indeed need appraisal by the group in relation to our
goals. My understanding from a brief perusal of his site is that he's trying
to establish a franework for creating a set (one day he hopes for a global
set) of descriptions of plants on the web, the data structured in such a way
as to be queryable as well as readable.

So, has Jean-Marc already done all that this group set out to do and can we
go home?

Two likely differences between the present attempt and his may be

1. that we need to create something more flexible so that any botanist can
capture any aspect of systematic data for any taxon - i.e. a Stipa can be
described just as fully as a Taraxacum and a Nepenthes, with data ranging
from morphology to anatomy, phytochemisty and gene sequences (the latter is
the only easy one). Jean-Marc's thing seems to me to be of the fairly
inflexible variety (see the earlier lexicon debate) i.e. systematic
description is reduced to filling in the blank spaces on the form provided:

Taxon name <fill in your taxon>
Leaves <phyllotaxy>; margins <indentation>; venation <type>.

I may be misrepresenting Jean-Marc's intentions here. Any comment?

2. Jean-Marc's model is directed towards capturing descriptions. We need to
also allow for identification data for the range of key programs available
and in the future. Thus, things like character sets, dependencies, allowing
for misinterpretations etc may perhaps have little meaning in Jean-Marc's
domain, but are critical in ours.

Does anyone think we shold discontinue our attempt and run with Jean-Marc's
instead?

At the very least, we should make sure that they're compatible, perhaps
seeing Jean-Marc's as a special-purpose subset of the general.

Hello

I have followed the debates about VRML/X3D for weeks, and it's time to
speak.

The aim of our project is to make botanical data available on Internet,
including 3D images.

We need a compact, non proprietary, preferably XML, clean definition for
complex 3D geometries.

It seems that a representation both compact and flexible should be based
on  mathematics. VRML's cones and cylinders are just special cases of
intersections of volumes defined by equations:
f(x,y,z)>=0

NURBS and Beziers patches are just special cases of surfaces defined by
3 functions R2 ---> R3
(u,v) ---> (X(u,v),Y(u,v),Z(u,v))

A solution is to use the content part of MathML. I have reviewed it: it
has the desired capabilities, i.e. allows to define functions and sets,
it is XML. Certainly only a subset of MathML is needed: n-dimentional
geometry, n>3 is not relevant. On the other hand, some geometrical
primitives could be added :
- convex hulls,
- recursive constructs like fractals and L-systems,
- transforms, deformations, parametrization, movement


My second point is about modular schemas versus monolythic Schemas. X3D
is a very "good" example of monolythic DTD. NOTHING is taken from the
XML world outside X3D.

It seems that Virtual Reality involves several layers that can be used
and designed independently:
- volumic objects definition (see above)
- colors and textures on volumic objects
- behavior of volumic objects among them (contact, glued or sliding,
rotating, interpenetrable, etc)
- behavior of volumic objects with User Interface
- a scene as composite Design pattern of volumic objects
- light sources
- scenarios (time-dependant aspect )
- sounds

Conclusion:

This need for a compact, non proprietary, preferably XML, clean
definition for complex 3D geometries is common with other important
domains:
- Computer Aided Design
- Architecture
- simulation in mechanics, physics, and biology

CAD is a very important field that has currently no XML non-proprietary
language. It seems that the proposed solution could bring an interesting
synergy able to speed up developments, together with a better design.
And also a common subset for CAD and Virtual Reality will bring new
possibilities to exchange data.
A well-designed model and XML syntax for virtual reality could also be
used for cartoons and video games.

Thats my current interpretation. Jean-Marc's model seems to
presuppose that the identification of the organism has
already taken place. With that identification involving
the allocation of properties.

Or have I mis-interpreted it?

Jean-Marc, perhaps you could provide some additional examples?

Hi,

I got some time last night to start giving this some thought. I've
got some questions:

1. Collation rules. These are currently unspecified. Any objections
if I leave them out of an attempt to express these in XML? We
can revisit and revise this portion as time goes on.

2. Collated Character source. I see these as essentially
a drill down mechanism that further identifies a 'bottom-level'
taxon. Is it reasonable to include character dependencies 'upwards'?
Am I right in believing that multiple character sets could drill
down into the same source (perhaps produced by different
organisations, researchers, techniques). In this case, is
there a principal source for going back upwards? It seems
unfair to expect a treatment to keep track of all other treatments
which point to it (I may be infering too much here).

3. Why should characters only have properties at the lowest level?
What is the 'lowest level' given that drill-down can occur? Could
you outline the reasoning here?

4. Its possible to provide a Character list internally to the
treatment or reference an external one. Will it be a requirement
that both could be used (i.e. combine the internal and external lists.)

Cheers,

L.

Not sure if I am misreading what you mean here, but if not, then I
whine thusly:

A /single/ character set can get to the same taxon in different
ways. Don't come up with something that guarantees that the key graph
must be a tree. Even dichotomous keys aren't actually always trees
even though when printed they often look so. They look so because
humans routinely impute structure from format, which is one thing XML
is supposed to help us avoid. Though you have to work to represent
non-trees in XML...

In an arbitrary directed acyclic graph, if an application wants to
know how it got from one node to another, it has to keep track of the
path or else climb upwards along each parent looking for a determining
character. The latter is an exponential strategy, but the size of key
graphs may well be too small to bother worrying about that.

BTW, this hopefully not absurd example suggests how much easier it is to
deal with sometimes---but not always---irrelevant characters using XML
and its semi-structured generalizations than using table and matrix
representations of character data.

Yes, by merging Flora descriptions with character-based data à la Delta.

Yes, it will make biological knowledge really accessible. For the query aspect,
I try to structure data in a way suitable to export to several kind of programs:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Delta and LucID
- databases, relational and OO

This assertion is "present by misinterpretation". The set of properties and
organs is of course not limited, although for convenience a standard set will be
provided.

You must not doubt about my commitment to integrate those things in a general
model. I'm currently searching funding/sponsorship because now I have to work on
this after normal work hours.
Anyway next monday I'll present a more detailed model and example, showing how
data and meta-data published on different sites can be used together.

We need to clarify what is meant by 'DELTA' in this context. The definition
of DELTA data in the 'DELTA Standard' document (included in the program
distribution and also available separately as
http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/standard/standard.exe) is deliberately
quite narrow:

     "The essential components of DELTA-format data are normally the
     'character list', the 'taxon or item descriptions', the 'character
     types', the 'implicit values', and the 'character dependencies'."

It was intended that only the 'data matrix' (ITEM DESCRIPTIONS), and a few
other directive that were necessary for interpreting the matrix would be
defined in the standard (e.g. 'implicit values' and 'character dependencies'
affect the interpretation of missing values).

In recent discussions, 'DELTA' has been used in the broader sense of some or
all of the features (directives) implemented in CONFOR, DeltaAccess, etc.
This is appropriate, as standardization requirements now go far beyond the
basic data matrix.

Intkey also implements arbitrary groupings of characters, and I agree with
Kevin that this is a useful feature, which needs to be retained. There may
also be a need for hierarchical groupings, but the CHARACTER HEADINGS
directive does not fill this need. These headings are purely for reading by
humans in certain contexts, they are not hierarchical (except perhaps
visually by means of font changes), and different ones may be needed in
different circumstances. They are often, but not always, the same as
the ITEM SUBHEADINGS, which appear in natural-language descriptions.

Intkey also implements arbitrary groupings of taxa.

DELTA associates notes with characters, not states. The notes can have RTF
markup. Associating notes with the character as a whole is sometimes
necessary, and is usually more convenient for the end user.

All of these features are also available in DELTA. In addition, text

In Intkey, this is handled by the same mechanism described in (3) - the
subkeys are just another type of associated file. These would typically be
other Intkey keys, but could be any file with an associated application,
e.g. a conventional key in HTML, or, presumably, a LucID key.

Dear Mike,

you're right of course that a Best algorithm can to some extent emulate
Progressive Revelation as I described it, but I think a fully worked-out PR
model would go further. Also, of course, it's silly to work from a fully
populated rectangular matrix if there's no intention of using all of it.
Better perhaps to use a data model that has a "matrix" representation or
equivalent at its core for the global data and a cloud of "data bits" for
the non-global stuff.

I think it's an important thing to try to implement this part, as it's a
fundanmental part of the structure but also new and difficult and we need to
give people a chance to comment & revise. The three main aspects of the
draft standard as documented are
1. The ability (but not necessity) to attribute every data element to a source
2. The ability to collate data from lower-level (e.g. real-data) to
higher-level (e.g. synthesized) sources
3. The open-ended hierarchical structure for character and taxon lists.

I haven't given a lot of thought to how the collation rules would work in
practice. The basic idea is this. Suppose you have one treatment that stores
base data (measurements etc) for observed specimens of your taxa, then
another treatment that wants to collate parts of these data to a taxon-level
character.

e.g. One file has

Character = "Spore length (um)"
        Taxon =  "Macrolepiota clelandii"
                Specimen = "CANB4545601"
                        Value = 15
                        Value = 18
                        ...
                Specimen = "CANB233976"
                        Value = 16
.....

The higher-level file wants to collate from this
Character = "Spore length (um)
        Taxon = "Macrolepiota clelandii"
                Minvalue = 15
                Maxvalue = 18

The collation necessary here is simple - "Find the limits of the range".
Other simple rules may be "Find the limits and mean", "Find the limits and
25% quartiles" etc. For multistate characters the most common rule will be
an additive one - "collect all values for the character and concatenate them":

Character = "Petal colour"
        Taxon =  "Lilium turkestanicum"
                Specimen = "CANB4545601"
                        Value = "Pink"
                Specimen = "CANB233976"
                        Value = "Purple"

Now, I don't know what's the best way of formulating the rules. Would you
simply have a set of standard names for rules as above, then leave it to the
processing program to do the work, or can the whole thing be embedded in the
XML (so that looking at the higher-level treatment with an XML interpreter
would show you the collated data)?

If the rules need to be formulated rather then just named the challenge is
to do it in such a way that an XML parser could do the collation, and a
klutz taxonomist could create their own if an existing one is not sufficient.

Is this possible or am I talking out of my stovepipe?

>2. Collated Character source. I see these as essentially
>a drill down mechanism that further identifies a 'bottom-level'
>taxon.

The necessary thing is to identify a path to the treatment that contains the
data for collation, and the taxa of the lower-level treatment that will
provide the data for a taxon in the current treatment. In the example above
it's perhaps deceptively simple, because the target taxa in the lower-level
treatment (in this case, the specimens) are nested within a taxon with the
same name as the current taxon in the higher-level treatment (Macrolepiota
clelandii or Lilium turkestanicum). This is perhaps the easiest way to do it
(thinking aloud now) - require that the taxon of interest exist somewhere in
the taxon hierarchy in both treatments, then step one down in in the
lower-level treatment to find the elements of interest. Does any of this
make sense to anyone - I'd quite like some support here, if anyone's still
out there.

>Is it reasonable to include character dependencies 'upwards'?

Don't know - I need to think about this more. There may be a problem if you
mix and match "up" and "down" dependency definitions. The thing is to choose
the one that will be most easily defined.

>Am I right in believing that multiple character sets could drill

I think you may be off the track (or I may be). A character dependency is a
property of a character or a state (depending whether it's an up or down
dependency). It should be internal to a treatment, so there's no "keeping
track" to worry about.

>3. Why should characters only have properties at the lowest level?
>What is the 'lowest level' given that drill-down can occur? Could

You're right - characters at higher levels may have properties also e.g.

Leaves
        venation
                prominence
                pattern

It may be worth providing notes, illustrations etc for "Leaves" so basic
information can be moved up the hierarchy. Similarly, an "up" dependency set
to "Leaves" would apply to all lower-level character items.

>4. Its possible to provide a Character list internally to the

Yes. The way I see it an external character list is a resource, but not a
constraint. If one is referenced a treatment builder should also be able to
1. define their own internal characters,
2. perhaps pick and choose amongst the characters from the referenced list,
rather than have to use them all.
I think such flexibility is necessary if lexica are to grow.

Possible?

There are many ways one can go from measurements to some sort of collation,
and this is an area where there is a fair amount of activity - I would have
thogutht that specifying rules was not the way to go.

Are you then going to have to specify all ranks in advance, so that one
knows what is up or down?  And how would one proceed if unranked naming
does indeed become popular?

This issue of character lists in advance gives me the heebie-jeebies.
Perhaps I am confusing the issue, but to a certain extent one could argue
that characters flow out of/depend on observations/measurements, so would a
character list in advance unduly constrain?  I am thinking of characters
like helobial/cellular/nuclear endosperm, which can and should be
decomposed, embryo development, anther wall development, etc.

By rule here I just mean a quasimathematical rule that the computer uses to
effect the collation. Some rules should be common and straightforward, such
as the "gather all values" rule, others may be specific to a
treatment/builder. As I envisage it, you (Peter) could formulate your own
rule for your own treatment to do the collation just as you want.

If there's a lot of activity in this area, can you help with this bit?

No, the system as I envisage it will be rank-free (I agree, we need to stay
ahead of the game here), and "up" and "down" will be locally defined
relative to the hierarchy as defined in the treatment. E.g.

Treatment 1: Key to Australian species of Rhamnaceae
Rhamnaceae
        Colletieae
                Discaria
                        Discaria nitida
                        Discaria pubescens

Treatment 2: Morphometric data for Discaria specimens
Discaria pubescens
        CANB4452885
        CANB4788710
Discaria nitida
        CANB9633902
        CANB9644921

Treatment 1 here defines Treatment 2 as the source for some collated
characters (e.g. leaf length) for the taxa of Discaria. When it's looking
for data for Discaria nitida it drills through Treatment 2 until it finds
Discaria nitida in it's hierarchy (in this case, at the top level). It then
assumes that all items at the next level down (specimens here) are source
items for collation.

Similarly, if another treatment were a key to genera of Rhamnaceae, it may
use Treatment 2 as its source, drill down to Discaria and collate data from
all items at the next level (in this case, species of Discaria).

The actual taxa in the hierarchies are rank-free and not constrained in
their definition. The only constraint would be that since the "taxon" name
is used for identification purposes it would need to be unique in a
treatment and common to both treatments. "Taxa" in this sense may equate to
formal taxa or they may be species groups, whatever.

Note that I still don't know whether all this collation business is actually
possible - I just thinks it's important to try something like this. I take
my cues in this from Peter (who's pointed out the importance of
transparently recording all the steps that lead to a "character" and its
"score" since these often hide a multitude of sins) and Bernie Hyland (are
you still out there Bernie?), who has built a key to rainforest trees of
Australia recording every measurement on every specimen used along the way.
We need a way of 1. recording all these data if they're available and 2.
automating the process of collating these data to higher levels.

For instance, in the above example, if one of the specimens measured as
Discaria nitida were redetermined to D. pubescencs, that change could be
made at the lowest level treatment, then the higher-level treatments would
automatically reflect the possible change in the "circumscription" of the taxa.

I agree Peter - I'm worried by predefined characters also. That's why I've
been arguing against building lexica into the standard. BUT, it seems to me
that if one is to proceed with these treatments there need to be a priori
defined characters. I don't know how to leave characters to define
themselves (flow out of) the observations/measurements.

I've suggested the structure of remote and local character lists to allow
people to share resources. If someone creates a list of characters for
Rhamnaceae and someone else finds that much of that list will be just the
ticket for Vitaceae, then they should be able to share. Perhaps
progressively global lexica will grow from this, perhaps not. There seems to
be such enthusiasm for lexica that we need to allow for their possibility,
but with a bottom-up rather then top-down approach to their creation.

Conversely, if other treatment builders want to opt out of constraining
lexica altogether, they should be alowed to do so also.

My understanding of your problem (I may be wrong) is that you have
difficulty with people using qualitative characters as handy (but dangerous)
shortcuts for characters that are in reality quantitative. There are no
Platonic ideals in the qualitative world, but the quantitative world gets
closer. Thus, "crassinucellate" is really an abstraction of a set of
measurements. I may argue that it's a handy abstraction, you'd argue that
it's a dangerous abstraction, and we'd both be right (this may be a bad
example as we'd probably both argue for the danger in crassinucellate, but
you get my drift).

As the standard stands, I could use Leaves: ovate as a character state in
one treatment, and you could use leaf length, width and distance to widest
point in yours (or some more sophisticated mathematical descriptor). Can we
do any better?

Both forms are necessary for efficient internal use in programs. It's also
convenient to have both forms available in the user interface of a data
editor (our DELTA Editor does this). However, one form is enough for a
data-exchange format - to have both (especially both together in the same
data set) would make reading and checking the data more difficult.

Worldwide Botanical Knowledge Base</h1></center>

<h4>
Biodiversity and nature conservancy</h4>

<ul>
<li>
thousands of species are disappearing forever,</li>

<li>
need quick identification of specimens from threatened areas, without
qualified
scientists;</li>

<li>
the knowledge is on paper like in Linnaeus' time,</li>
</ul>
==> an inventory of the biological inheritance of our earth has to be
done.
<p>There is currently no other botanical project with this scope.
<br>Why ?
<ul>
<li>
funds go rather to biotechnologies than to descriptive biology,</li>

<li>
pluri-displinarity is not easy</li>
</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h4>
Aim</h4>
to make botanical data available on&nbsp; Internet :
<ul>
<li>
description of the species, including 2D and 3D pictures,</li>

<li>
geographical distribution,</li>

<li>
computer-aided identification of specimens</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Initial intuitions:</h4>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="Samples/protoGUI.htm">relational DB</a></li>

<li>
uncouple data (XML) and processing (relational DB, OO DB, AI
engines)</li>

<li>
offer <a href="User_Interfaces.htm">easy access</a> to detailed
knowledge
both for the layman and the professional botanist</li>

<li>
federate existing resources and people</li>
</ol>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h4>
The metadata</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Why a relational DB is not enough: example of bark and stem</li>

<ul>
<li>
bark is a part of stem (and trunk)</li>
</ul>

<li>
different levels of metadata</li>

<li>
several sources of metadata: Floras, <a
href="wordnet.htm">Wordnet</a></li>

<li>
Abstract Data Model: <a href="UML_diagrams.htm">UML diagrams</a></li>

<li>
uses of metadata: GUI, reasoning</li>
</ul>

<h4>
The data exists</h4>

<ul>
<li>
more than 90% of the 250 000 species are on Floras on paper, and lots
are
<a href="existing.htm">on the Web</a> in HTML (not XHTML!);</li>

<li>
herbarium images; also many are on the Web (e.g. 30 000 species in
Florida)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Vision</h4>
Imagine you're in nature, with a portable computer running the&nbsp;
botanical
database, with a camera, a GPS, and a wireless Internet connection.
Suddenly
you meet a remarkable plant; you show it to the computer, which asks you
two questions about the number of carpels, and the shape of hairs
(answers
needs a cutting of the ovary, and lenses). The computer tells you that
this a new location of Strasburgeria robusta, which was thought to exist
only in New Caledonia. You are proposed to send e-mails to the
specialists
of the Strasburgeriaceae, and of the region, and to collect a herbarium
specimen. Meanwhile this discovery, complete with images and
geographical
coordinates, is sent to the global database, and the updated repartition
map appears on the screen.
<h4>
A free sofware / free information project</h4>

<ul>
<li>
nobody can own nature</li>

<li>
a great project for humanity, and</li>

<li>
a great, far-reaching, and enjoyable software project.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Collaborations</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Flora of China ( http://flora.harvard.edu/china/ ),</li>

<li>
Taxonomic Databases Working Group</li>

<li>
Kew Botanical Gardens</li>
</ul>

<h4>
New kind of software needed</h4>
A multi-everything browser will in fact be an empty shell
<ul>
<li>
calls the appropriate processors when it sees certain XML namespaces
and/or
Processing Instructions.</li>

<li>
multi-domain documents</li>

<li>
manage drag'n drop and clipboard with an XML data model.</li>

<li>
editor with the same multi-domain capabilities.</li>

<li>
manage the display space between XML processors (tiling, resize,
...).</li>

<li>
manage the mapping between raw XML and displayed XML transformed by
XSLT</li>

<li>
Generic display skills are also desirable:</li>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collapsable tree/graph views for:</li>

<ul>
<li>
document tree</li>

<li>
inheritance graph</li>

<li>
the ID/IDREF graph</li>
</ul>

<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extended search/query</li>
</ul>

<li>
using a standard dictionary (e.g. wordnet) and some AI techniques will
enable to treat well-formed XML with a natural vocabulary of tags</li>
</ul>
A general and modular tool for manipulating data, of the 3 main kinds:
<ul>
<li>
document-oriented (HTML &amp; word processor)</li>

<li>
structure-oriented (database type)</li>

<li>
knowledge-oriented (semantic network, AI, RDF, etc)</li>
</ul>
The next killer-app ... A role for Mozilla ? or Gnome? KDE ? or will the
next Microsoft Wave submerge all ?
<h4>
2D and 3D images</h4>

<ul>
<li>
vectorized images (SVG) from bitmap images</li>

<li>
3D images (X3D, etc) generated from several pictures through
stereoscopic
software</li>

<li>
very compact representations adapted to growing beings having recursive
structure: L-Systems, <a href="3Dgeometry.htm">MathML</a>, etc</li>

<li>
<a href="image_processing.htm#image_chain">Artificial Vision</a>
techniques</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Botany, Zoology, Ecology and the Semantic Web</h4>

<ul>
<li>
express relations between plants and animals in a formal and flexible
way
(RDF/XLink)</li>

<li>
plants (250 000) are just a beginning: insects alone have 1 000 000
species</li>

<li>
all kinds of properties, and properties about properties</li>

<li>
XML is not just to catalog consumers's preferences and locate the
cheapest
merchandise</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Conclusions</h4>

<ul>
<li>
do great things with little resources, like Amp&egrave;re in the 19th
century</li>

<li>
plants are like software: you can clone easily, but some try to
copyright
them</li>

<li>
make standards for 20 years or more</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="XMLprotocol.htm">distributed knowledge</a> on the Web</li>

<li>
AI techniques and XML exchange formats/protocols for AI</li>

<li>
authoring side</li>

<li>
new ways of working for taxonomic scientists: new species created by Web
transaction, etc</li>

<li>
Problems with existing standards</li>

<ul>
<li>
overlapping concepts: RDF and Xlinks, RDF Schemas and XML Schemas</li>

<li>
development of monolythic vocabularies, little reuse of Schemas and
concepts</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Visual plant identification</h3>
Here is some information about visual plant identification, for the
non-botanists.
<p>Since Linnaeus and until today, plant classification is based on
flowers.
Flowers, unlike flat leaves and linear stems, are essentially 3D
structures.
This means that one can rarelly see all the significant features on a
single
flat image. Also equal but differently orientated organs (like petals)
will appear unequal. Also there is possible confusion beetwen an
individual
flower and an inflorescence (gathering of small flowers, like the
clover).
The color is often not a discriminating character, since it can vary
within
a single species.
<br>A typical flower is composed, from bottom to top, of 5 rings (or
verticillas)
of pieces attached on a vertical axis:
<ul>
<li>
bracts</li>

<li>
sepals</li>

<li>
petals</li>

<li>
etamins (male part)</li>

<li>
carpels (female part)</li>
</ul>
Any of those 5 verticillas can be missing, or be joined within a
verticilla
or with the next one. The number of pieces in a verticilla can be
beetwin
1 and several tens, 5 being a frequent number.
<p>Leaves also have discriminating characters, and are (generally) 2D.
These characters are:
<br>- shape
<br>- veins (better seen on the underside)
<br>- differents types of hairs, better distinguished by touch or by
lenses
<br>- sometimes color
<p>So you see, plant images are a challenge for a 2D general purpose
image
system.
<h3>
Bibliography on plant morphology</h3>
If you want to read more, or just see images, here are some good books
I use on general botany:
<p>In french:
<ul>
<li>
Pr&eacute;cis de botanique - 2. v&eacute;g&eacute;taux
sup&eacute;rieurs;
Gaussen, Leroy, Ozenda, &eacute;ditions Masson</li>

<li>
La botanique red&eacute;couverte; Aline Reynal, &eacute;ditions Belin
1995</li>

<li>
Les plantes &agrave; fleurs - Guide morphologique illustr&eacute;;
Adrian
D. Bell, &eacute;ditions Masson</li>
</ul>
In english:
<ul>
<li>
Plant form - An illustrated Guide to flowering plant morphology; Adrian
D. Bell, at Oxford Un. Press</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Image generation</h3>

<h4>
L-Systems</h4>
There is a classic book on L-Systems applied to modelize plant growth 2
years ago (Prusinkiewicz, P. and Lindenmayer, A.,1990, The Algorithmic
Beauty of Plants, Springer Verlag), and there is a French Institute
called
Cirad which does this sort of things for plants (they are on WWW but I
haven't seen pictures). Here are some links,&nbsp; having a wealth of
information
and links to other sites:
<br>&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.ctpm.uq.edu.au/virtualplants/ipiwww.html">http://www.ctpm.uq.edu.au/virtualplants/ipiwww.html</a>
<br><a
href="http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/bmv/software.html">http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/bmv/software.html</a>
<p><a NAME="image_chain"></a>Of course L-Systems is a link in the chain
we envision:
<ul>
<li>
2 or 3 pictures from different angles --></li>

<li>
3D representation (with Bezier mappings or whatever) --></li>

<li>
pattern recognition --> L-Systems --></li>

<li>
static or growth simulation images</li>
</ul>
Sure this is a too big picture for now!
<p>So we can enter L-Systems models in the database. I see the following
advantages to this representation:
<ul>
<li>
L-Systems capture truly biological features, like branching angles,</li>

<li>
species in the same genus or family will share a lot of growth
patterns,</li>

<li>
this is a way to generate very accurate images with very little
information.</li>
</ul>
I want to know more on this subject, especially are there many
downloadable
plants available, with a rigourous taxonomic identity ?
<p>What is not clear now to me (this is not an urgent issue) is:
<br>Will we develop, or is there, a XML vocabulary for L-Systems, or
will
a L-System definition remain "just" a character string.
<br>The avantage of a XML vocabulary would be to have a unified syntax,
from which a non-graphical processor could extract information of
taxonomic
relevance. From a XML representation, it is easy to generate a standart
L-System definition, using a XSLT stylesheet.
<h3>
3D recognition</h3>
Here is a <a href="http://cermics.enpc.fr/~keriven/home.html">home
page</a>
about stereoscopic and other algorithms for extracting 3D information
out
of 2D images. We currently try to learn more about stereoscopic systems,
especially for shapes having edges and folds.
<p>I'm currently evaluating free downloads, notably Geometra. The demo
I saw in their site is a house, having sharp edges; the user must click
on&nbsp; 2 or more points in the 2D pictures, before 3D information is
computed.
<p>The next stage in our project would be to generate from the 3D facets
a compact, non proprietary, preferably XML, clean <a
href="3Dgeometry.htm">definition
for complex 3D geometry</a> in the form of reunions and intersections of
volumes defined by equations:
<p>f(x,y,z)>=0
<p>and (e.g. NURBS and Beziers patches) surfaces defined by 3 functions
R2 ---> R3
<p>(u,v) ---> (X(u,v),Y(u,v),Z(u,v))
<p>But this "next stage" is probably still a research subject. But this
should not prevent us from gathering pictures from different angles, and
generate 3D information out of it.

<h2>
Specimen identification</h2></center>
This is a beginning of specification for an application, that could be
a browser extension, realizing a Specimen identification. For now it
doesn't
take into account the contribution of image recognition.
<p>The user narrows its choice until there is only one species possible.
But the user has more freedom than in a tree-driven dialog &agrave; la
Delta, (s)he can enter at any time a character that appears particular
and discriminating. On the other hand, the classical identification keys
of Floras are tree-structured, and take in account only a kew
characters.
<p>There will be an input field for a character with three ways of
entering
organ, property, and value:
<ul>
<li>
automatic completion in an input field</li>

<li>
point and click on an image of a schematic plant with all organs present
(with a possibility to supress organs that are not present)</li>

<li>
pull-down menu</li>
</ul>

<p><br>This is possible because the relevant meta-data has been
downloaded
from server: list of organs, properties, and values (see <a
href="XMLprotocol.htm">XML
protocol</a>).
<p>At any stage the following items are recomputed and proposed to the
user:
<ul>
<li>
the number of species corresponding to the list of characters
entered</li>

<li>
the most discriminating questions</li>

<li>
the list of possible families or genus, possibly presented as a tree
view</li>
</ul>
When the identification is advanced enough, the system will display an
identikit picture (portrait-robot) of the plant or flower or leaf, that
will be recomputed at each step.

I am not sure to what you are referring. Do you mean simply lists of names or
are you after useful information such as descriptions, maps, illustrations?

Where can one view a Flora of Australia on the Web, I wonder?

FloraBase (http://www.calm.wa.gov.au/science/florabase.html), maintained by the
 Western Australian Herbarium, includes brief descriptions, specimen lists and
maps of all 12,500 vascular plant species occuring in this state. This
represents ca half of the continent's flora and covers ca one third of its
area. For each species an information page can be retrieved on-line comprising
its scientific and common names, an indication of its status (native, alien,
priority if threatened), a description, a map and (if available) a composite
colour photograph showing habitat, habit, floral and fruit characteristics.
Form-based query tools enable one to retrieve information or identify species
on the basis of nomenclatural, geographic and/or morphological fields. There
are also facilities for users to suggest corrections (eg redeterminations) to
the various databases which underlie FloraBase.

Over the coming months FloraBase will be extended to include highly detailed
descriptions of genera and families. Over the horizon, the descriptive data
will be expanded by use of a much larger character set.

Another Australian botanical information system that may be worth your
attention is The National Herbarium of New South Wales' PlantNet site
(http://plantnet.rbgsyd.gov.au/).

The HISCOM site (http://www.rbgsyd.gov.au/HISCOM/default.htm) provides a
springboard for those embarking on a virtual foray in search of the Australian
flora.

Hello

To prepare my presentation at the 9th International World Wide Web
Conference - Amsterdam, May 15-19, 2000 (http://www.www9.org/) , I would
like to have the pourcentage of species among the estimated
 250 000 plant species that are on regional Floras :
1. - on paper,
2. - in some computerized form (HTML, etc)

The following are on the Web :
Flora of China
Flora of Australia
Flora of North America (www.fna.org)

Yes, I'm still out here, I'm a taxonomist and I'm still interested in
contributing to the requirements analysis.

I guess that I have to reply now since I said I would.

I even read your treatment description proposal.

The material covered in it is all useful even if we can not agree on the
format
and extent of the list yet.

I do not see how we can avoid mixing data in a treatment. I'll need to go back
and reread Bob's comments on that. Generally I don't see how we can have a
standard that requires all fields to be reduced to finite states. Some things
will just need to be unprocessed (by the computer) text.

Perhaps people should propose which like items should be deleted, added or
modified (and how to modify them).

Dear Colleagues,

you will all be aware that the SDD list fell over several months ago. My
interpretation of this is that many of the taxonomists on the list were
left behind, perhaps early on, by the energetic discussions over issues of
data structuring (XML, schemas, RDF etc). Most of this was certainly way
over my head. Things got too top-heavy, and attempts to structure the
discussion using message tags didn't seem to provide much focus.

Recent discussions (at a meeting on US-Australian cooperation in
bioinformatics in Washington, July 2000, attended by several SDD
contributors) has again highlighted the great need for an SDD standard and
shown that the lack of a new, inclusive standard is holding back progress
on descriptive databasing and software design.

We need to restart the list with better focus. I'd like to suggest that the
way forward is to entirely set aside (for the time being) any discussion of
data structure and focus entirely on content (the requirements analysis)
for a while. We should agree on an outline of the data that we need to
capture, then pass this on to the computerheads to provide a best-practice
structure for storing and managing this captured data.

The attached document was put up to the list shortly before it fell over.
It's attached again here, slightly edited. ANY TAXONOMISTS STILL OUT THERE
- please look at this. What data that you need to capture aren't handled
here? Will this work? Is this the way to proceed?

I think that the document subsumes the data requirements of the DELTA and
Lucid programs, plus a bit more particularly in the areas of data
attribution and hierarchical nesting of treatments. The intention is that
the elements in this list should provide a way of storing any data needed
to describe the morphology or anatomy of any organism or taxon.

Note that this should be read merely as a list of data elements - the
structure of the list does not imply a structure for the data file (XML or
otherwise) used to store the data.

It may be the case that this document can be jointly modified to produce a
final document, or we may need to start from scratch with another. Any ideas?

Cheers - k

Kevin et al,

I think there are many people still subscribed to this
list  (http://usobi.org/archives/index.html indicates that TDWG-SDD has 109
subscribers).    Go ahead and assume that anyone who is NOT still
interested will unsubscribe themselves.  The rest are here to listen,
learn, and participate as we can.

I'm not sure what you mean by "fell over".  I don't think there were any
technical problems, only a shortage of energy and time.

I think we still have a good mix of technical and biological skills
represented in the membership.  Your suggestion to focus on requirements is
a good one.  Your draft looks like a good start.

Thanks for reviving the list,

-Stan

Kevin
thanks for starting up this list again.  Since I joined its been deathly
quiet!

It makes sense to me to step back from structure initially.  I missed the
discussions that occured before the silence and wonder if we can go one step
further back.  Is there somewhere a clear definition of purpose?
- who will use this,
- to store what types of information and
- for what kinds of description (for identification as with DELTA) for
cladistics, for publishing to other audiences
- to do what (for exchanging data between different databases, as a public
format upon which independent applications will run).

I'd appreciate it if someone could point me at a summary of your previous
deliberations on this.

many thanks and best wishes

Kevin
your document makes interesting reading.  Further to my earlier email on
purpose  I see how morphological descriptive data (such as DELTA handles -
which may well be the primary aim) would fit within your described format.

IF your aim were for this format also to serve for:

1) description of distribution (a hierarchical descriptor - with attributes
attached to each substate such as native/introduced/etc)

2) description of use [e.g. taxon- plantpart(eg leaf) - forwhom (eg
children) - forwhat (eg sorethroat) - how (eg infusion)]

3) description of ecology - requiring links between two "descriptors" (eg.
plant A is a tree at altitude X BUT plant A is a bush at altitude Y)

   then Im less clear how these would be accomodated.  Is there elsewhere a
set of descriptor/state structures that I could see?

best wishes

Kevin and colleagues,

As per our discussions at the US-Australia Workshop, I would again reiterate a few
general observation with respect to the list and express my agreement with specific
comments made by you, Bryan Heidorn, and Stan Blum.  However, with your indulgence,
I would also like to provide what may be a somewhat different perspective.

The focus on "requirements" for a descriptive data standard for taxonomy, as you
and Stan emphasize is a critical one, even though as Bryan points out there remains
a number of issues that need to be dealt with that may not be fully accounted for
in the draft standard you have kindly provided.  I would agree that we need a
mechanism (structure?) for subsequent discussion on the list to permit both
general, theoretical issues to be addressed, while simultaneously breaking down the
practical realities of dealing with the complexity of specific issues involved that
at times dictates useful "digression" into jargon-laden specifics that might be
relevant for particular implementation issues that require vigorous discussion.
I'm not sure at this stage whether it is possible, at least in my own mind, to
distinguish structure from content, since dealing with existing structure and
content may be necessary to define what we perceive are requirements.  My own sense
of the previous discussion is that there are a variety of perspectives as to what
constitutes "descriptive data" and "requirements" in this context, as well as what
are the specific priorities (aspects of "standards") that are necessary for
specific applications (eg DELTA and LUCID) to intercommunicate in an
application-neutral manner.  However, mixing them into a common thread proved a bit
overwhelming.

My own bias is for a better understanding of how we can construct such a "draft
standard" so that it is open to considerable extension for the incorporation of
meta-language descriptors for more esoteric data structures, while maintaining a
flexible general framework needed to associate existing "character" data, while
also addressing the practical necessity of managing various "annotations" of
qualitative characters.   I believe this is important primarily because we ultimate
want machines to do most of the translating among formats, with minimal loss of
information or human intervention.  I believe it is also important for the more
difficult task that lies ahead of encoding means for machines to "feature
extract" across a multiplicity of representations of character data.

As a taxonomists/morphologist I am constantly confronted with new data formats and
widely different data sources.  Virtually all are created in specific contexts and
do not generally have a "web-wide" mechanism for associating their content.  For
example, it is difficult for me to determine if there exist data sets that
encompass different "encodings" of information pertaining to specific structures
for specific taxa.  I need a dyanamic mechanism that will permit me to become aware
of data sets pertaining to say the pectoral fins of a particular scorpionfish,
without having to know in advance that such data may exist in the form of 1) a
collections record of a skeleton in a particular collection, 2) a published data
set characterizing the measurements taken from a particular study, 3) a CAT scan of
such a critter, 4) an archive containing the representation of specific character
states used in a phylogenetic analysis, 5) numerous gif/jpg files of radiographs of
specimens, 6) a text based description of the pectoral fins in a fossil, 7) the
title of a paper describing the sensory innervation of the fin, or 8) a database of
specific HOX genes involved in fin formation.

Certainly, the Rich Attribution component of your document is critical element for
this, but I do not yet see how I can use this document to establish the "meta-data
wrapper" needed to compile such a list, much less establish to what extent I can
use such a text based "wrapper" to associate these disparate kinds of taxonomic
data.  How do I deal with data that are largely numeric in content or purely
graphic (pixel encoded)?  Nonetheless, I would agree that there is a need for a
series of "collation rules" to establish scope at different hierarchical levels or
for specific context-oriented activity.  I would, for example, add  several lower
levels still in this context (including parts of specimens as described at the
organ, tissue, and cellular, subcellular, and molecular level).  Of course, the
difficulty here is that resolution and context may create data structures that are
not entirely hierarchical, particularly for objects of composite origin or study.
For the nervous system in chordates one can break down the system into units with
respect to various elements that could in one sense be heirarchical (perhaps brain,
spinal chord, ramus lateralis accessorius, neuron, motor unit, motor endplate,
etc.).  However, with respect to a physiological classification dealing with action
at the level of specific neurons this classification scheme would not work since
the nerve is composite and composed of both sensory and motor elements.  Likewise,
it would be difficult to place neuroendrocrine components, specific neuropeptides,
or developmental anlagen, such as placodes, however important, into a parallel
heirarchy.  Likewise, usefully descriptive properties could not be easily
restricted to specific components.  I found the discussion at the workshop
regarding the use of acyclic directional graphs as a fundamental data structure
most interesting, but I'm not sure that morphological descriptors, perhaps unlike
gene products, are necessarily acyclic.  For example, a specific bone such as the
mandible can be classified as an element of the visceral skeleton as well as a
composite element containing both endochondral as well as dermal bone.  If one
looks early enough in development, one can't even recognize these anatomical
distinctions, although they may exist at a molecular level.  How should structures
that change with development or function be tagged and associated?  Would this not
depend upon context?  Nonetheless, following from your document, it might be a
useful excercise to consider to what extent certain classes of morphological
descriptors can be considered in such a graph-theoretical framework from which we
might be able to establish certain constructs as useful in associating otherwise
disparate, yet specific data (glossaries?).  Trees certainly are a useful data
structure for description of many morphological features, but not the only ones.

Consequently, it might be useful to break up the discussion into sub-discussions or
threads for which specific requirements can be more readily circumscribed and for
which the makings of a "meta-language" needed to search and assimilate alternate
representations might be more quickly forthcomming.  This is important because the
universe of potentially different data structures for encoding character data is
very large.  There is no need for those interested primarily in DELTA - LUCID
translations, or LUCID - PHYLIP, etc. transformations to be held up by more
specific requirements concerning translations/annotations of more arcane data
structures, even though some, like Bryan and I, may feel that transformations
between "other kinds" of data structures must also be incorporated in a way that
allows their potential richness to be exploited.  However, acheiving such
extensibility will require the "standard discriptors" to be be quite general (but
not ambiguous) in construction.

Such an approach might permit us to generalize across a number of possibly highly
specific topics and requirements that are not universally applicable and with which
many of us are differentially fluent.  This approach would be especially useful,
should we begin at a latter point begin to use them to construct XML schema or to
outline what might be necessary using XSLT to transform them from one XML format to
another.  Since XML is promising as a data neutral specification language, we might
want to maintain a separate "XML thread", and perhaps even various XML
(alternative)-implementaton subthreads (Java XML API's vs MS XML API's, vs "others?
or DTD's vs Schemas, "elements" vs "atributes", etc.) that will influence how such
a "standard" could currently be implemented.  Although certainly I would agree that
we do not want implementations to drive the standards, it is important to have an
understanding of how potential implementation might affect the utility of the
standards.  It might be useful here to draw an analogy to the presentation made at
the workshop by Sue Rhee in her discussion of the need for an "ontological"
database for common annotation of gene function across molecular databases.
Likewise, we need a generalized means of characterizing the "language" used to
describe the various entries in different "glossaries" used to describe character
data.  The need for such "cross molecular" databases would not arise, except for
specific implementation issues that are not presently adequately addressed.
Likewise, your "External lexica" might be usefully encompassed in the concept of
XML name spaces.  Although I can't think of specific examples off the top of my
head, some anatomical terms are used differently in different contexts ("viens" in
animals and plants might be a simple example).  We need to be able to distinguish
the contexts.  Perhaps this is what you mean by global versus local characters?

Hence, from my perspective it might be useful for the dialog to move forward along
several separate, yet not entirely distinct threads, where folks with specific
interests could provide input as they see fit, ignoring that which seems
irrelevant.  A few may even want to keep their thumbs in all the pies.  In glancing
over what has come before, we might consider as possible threads: 1) general
theoretical perspectives on "taxonomic data", 2) one or more application specific
threads (ie DELTA, LUCID, "phylogeny packages", NEXUS, others?, etc.), 3) issues
pertaining to description and characterization of qualitative data, 4) issues
pertaining description and characterization of quantitative characters, 5) issues
pertaining to text based description (semi-structured data), 6) issues pertaining
to structured data (ie relational or object modeled data structures), and
7) meta-language requirements (headers, tagging architecture, XML etc.).  No doubt
you or others might be able to amend these or to add a few others from within which
we might eventually reach consensus on assembly of a few key requirements that are
general to all and from which interoperable implementation could proceed so as to
be able to assess the usefulness of our work.  Perhaps some threads could rule out
discussion of "content" and others "structure".  In any event, it might be useful
to let natural selection act to allow the most productive threads to survive and
"establish focus", while the others die out, without letting the whole wither
because of the complexity and interconnection of the fundamental issues.

No doubt some of these threads will might morph into monsters not anticipated.
Consequently, to keep it all coordinate, there must be some general
agreement/understanding to focus on common requirements (GOALS) that we are trying
to acheive.  However, at this early stage, these might be largely implict so as not
to lock ourselves into unnecessarily narrow perspectives.  For this to work,
perhaps one or two "ring masters" or "virtual ushers (bouncers?)" are needed to
keep the various performers and audience on cue, to summarize progress from time to
time, and to remove, add, or combine  threads at key moments  (ie oversee and exert
some "administrative" control over the various threads).  This is important  so
that a specific set of useful general requirements is forthcomming in a timely
fashion.  I nominate you and Bryan (actually you guys nominated yourselves in
Boston or was it unanimous proclamation?).   Subsequent to such general and
specific discussion, I believe we would then be in a better position to respond to
specific requests for comments on documents, such as that you have put forth
outlining draft standards.

Still here too, although I have been silent lately.

I am in reasonably good agreement with Stuart Poss on what needs to be
done with relation to data structures and standards - good work Stuart.
I will add, briefly, that the issues, in my mind are clearly being
debated beyond their level of resolution in that I really don't think
that we should be wasting our time trying to figure out sets of
descriptors for specific taxa, the inherent data hierarchy and
descriptive extensibility are the important things.  As much as I would
like not to admit it, I have not yet been convinced that DELTA cannot
function for us as the basis for taxonomic data structure.  We will
never regulate descriptor terminology because creative careful
observation and the creative and clear semantics involved in
communicating those observations completely is the basis of all
observational biology.  The strength of Systematics as a science is
really in our diversity of ways of making observations and communicating
them.

Do we need this? I think yes.  We need to expand it.

With respect to what needs to be done by TDWG in the big picture. My
priority is in developing reliable authority files.  Our efforts at
making reliable and updateable authority files for many groups and types
of data are in their infancy and every database is suffering because of
it.  Content and structure are both important and we have heard from
several clearly gifted thinkers on structure.  I think that we need to
put some more enegry, as a group, into ways to generate more and better
content.

Cheers,

Stinger

Just a couple of brief comments.

I agree as well with most of Starts thoughtful comments. It is even worth
putting into my keep folder on this issue to review whenever I make the
mistake
of thinking I've covered all of the bases.

The other comment is that I don't think that it is useful to think of this
as a
standard that data must be stored in by anyone. It is better thought of as a
gateway like Z39.50 (and ZBIG). Your data on your computer stays in whatever
format is best for your application, it is only when you want to share that
data that you provide the "standard" view of the data. It is also not
necessary
that we specify any particular set of characters or character states. What be
need is a mechanism for having one computer (agent 1) ask the other computer
(Agent 2), "Hey you, what data do you have?"

Reply from Agent 2, "I have plant morphology data, some specimens with
images,... and I can give them to you in Format X. Want 'um?"

Agent 1,  "Sure, what characters to you have encoded?"

Agent 2, "I have Angiosperm Macrobiology set 1 Version 1.2 and Microbiology
Set
2 Version 13.3."

Agent 1, "I'll have the Angiosperm set, for species X, Y and Z. Thank you."

Agent 2, "<taxonid>....</taxonid><morphology><plantheightmaximun units=m
Authority=Caldwell98>5</plantheightmaximum><plantheightminimum units=m
Authority=Caldwell98>2</plantheightminimum>....</morphology>.....

There needs to be a little authorization conversation between the computers
before this to make sure that Agent 1 had access to all of the data that agent
2 can provide... This sort of thing is done in Z39.50 and other protocols all
of the time. SpeciesAnalyst does it for some data.

The format of the data on Agent 2's disk is anything at all, an MySQL
database,
flat files, whatever. It is just the gateway software that knows the standard.

I assume that for now what we need to focus on is providing a framework so
that
some Angiosperm expert could create a "sub-standard" definition "Angiosperm
Macrobiology set 1 ". Right?

Having said that, I am off for the lake county of Michigan.
Back in a week. I hope you all have this figured out by the time I return.

Cheers,
Bryan

You're right that the structure at the moment does not accommodate some
data types well. It uses the standard structure of a character list where
each character has a list of states and taxa are scored for those states.
Distribution data particularly could use a more sophisticated approach -
sometimes we can fit distribution into this (e.g. Character = "Which
continent?" States = "Australia", "Antarctica" etc.) But can we do better?

Can you suggest a way to accommodate your suggestions?

You mean like the "Text" character type of DELTA?, or unparsed textual
notes attached to characters/states/taxa/data items?

Bob Allkin,

Gregor Hagedorn's original posting to the list explains the brief we
received from TDWG. That would be a good starting point - you can get it
(and all previous list correspondence) downloaded by sending the
appropriate message to the server {can anyone tell Bob what that message is?}

This is my take on your questions.

>- who will use this,

Potentially anyone who needs to capture and manage descriptive data, but
this will have to wait on development of appropriate tools. Initially, and
in a more limited scope, it will serve as an interchange format between
existing programs e.g. Lucid, DELTA, XID etc (assuming the developers of
those programs come to the party and write I/O functions.

>- to store what types of information

I think initially we need to be flexible enough to be able to store any
type of morphological or anatomical data. Some chemical descriptive data
could fit in here as well, at least simple "chemical A: present/absent"
statements. I suppose the main thing we seem to be leaving out for the time
being is genome, sequence and protein data - too specialised for our
present purpose?

>- for what kinds of description (for identification as with DELTA) for
>cladistics, for publishing to other audiences

Initially, I think we should aim at descriptions and interactive ID. This
is a problematical area, that I think should be explored more. The idea of
massaging one data file into two or more different products (e.g.
natural-language and keys) is very attractive, but surprisingly
problematical, since the structure of data needed for the two purposes is
often subtly different. Of course, doing just this is the basis of the
DELTA system, but we may need to do it in a more sophisticated way.

As for cladistics, this is more problematical. In the early days of the
list there was much enthusiasm about our standard subsuming NEXUS. I think
I'm right in thinking that the NEXUS people thought this was a bit of a
joke - NEXUS is widely used, is widely supported and seems to be highly
successful, while ours doesn't even exist yet! The problems inherent in the
multiple-product model become even more alarming when you try to maintain
one data file for both description/identification and phylogenetic
analysis. My personal view is that we should leave cladistics out of the
scope at least for the time being. Anyone else out there want to comment on
this?

>- to do what (for exchanging data between different databases, as a public
>format upon which independent applications will run).

Initially, as an interchange format for existing applications, but if it
works, hopefully a new generation of applications will flow.

>I'd appreciate it if someone could point me at a summary of your previous
>deliberations on this.

Other contributors - is this a fair summary?

There is a welcome message by Gregor Hagedorn at
http://usobi.org/archives/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A1=ind9911d&L=tdwg-sdd#19

You can see a number of other important (organizing) messages from Gregor
if you go to the root of the SDD archive
( http://usobi.org/archives/tdwg-sdd.html ), then to "November 1994, Week
4" at the bottom, then select browse by author, etc...

The examples Bob gives are very complicated (higher order logic? [he
suggests quickly getting in over his head in formalisms!]).&nbsp; At
least part of the complication derives from the fact the
&quot;subject&quot; is a species (or taxon) rather than a specimen, and
is necessarily a summary of primary data.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I think we talked earlier about the simplest sorts of statements taking
the form of a logical triple: <br>
<br>
<tt>[THING]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ATTRIBUTE
CLASS]&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ATTRIBUTE VALUE]<br>
[fish-123] --&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [dorsal
spines]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; [11]<br>
<br>
</tt>A simple (minded?) solution to Bob's example #3 might be to
accommodate the complexity by narrowing the scope of the THING:<br>
<br>
<tt>[plant A at altitude X] --&gt; [growth form]&nbsp; --&gt;
[tree]<br>
[plant A at altitude Y] --&gt; [growth form]&nbsp; --&gt; [bush]<br>
<br>
</tt>This might be a bad approach...&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; The point I
want to make is that the statements above are simple, whereas statements
like<br>
<br>
<tt>PART-A of TAXON-B is used by CULTURE-C for FUNCTION-D in
SITUATION-E<br>
<br>
</tt>are so close to natural language, that the software/standards
problem is WAY beyond our capabilities.&nbsp; I think we should designate
this level of complexity as &quot;out of scope&quot;.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I would rather see us focus on the scope implied by the union of: 1)
basic description (Delta), 2) identification (IntKey, Lucid, etc.), and
3) phylogenetics (PAUP and McClade).&nbsp; I think that's a pretty
significant challenge.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -- finally -- <br>
<br>
Would it be possible to get &quot;data models&quot; (or at least
simplified &quot;core&quot; models) of the relevant applications posted

we have them.<br>

Hi there Colleagues

Yes, I'm also still out here too & am still very interested in 'listening
to' & contributing to the requirements analysis. While I work on aspects of
data curation for corn/maize (Zea mays L.) there is a rapidly growing need
for interoperability between databases of various kinds (regarding taxon
composition & data composition) - this is one of the 'coal faces' I'm
working with right now. So thanks for getting the pot stirred again. I'll
try & contribute when possible. The goal of this interaction is exciting (if
not pretty formidable).

Regards,
- Leszek Vincent

Dear Stuart,

I agree completely with everything you say, but it worries me all the same.
You point out the complexity of descriptive data and the enormity of the
task of completely capturing it. But we need to get something done, and I
think we need some incremental stages.

Your suggestion as to maintaining threads of discussion is not unlike the
way the list was running before it fell over. Some of the threads did
indeed morph into monsters, others got lost and I think many people with
them. I'd really like to try for a while keeping the discussion focused on
the document with the proposed list of elements, to glean suggestions from
people as to whether it's completely inadequate or what. At the same time,
of course, I don't want to constrain people to run with this or with my
suggested way of doing things. I may well be way off the track of what's
possible or achievable. Working up the document may provide us with an
incremental advance, or it may be that such incremental advances are not
worth achieving and your suggestion for a great leap forward is the way to
go. My way of looking at it is that if DELTA is a bicycle, I'm proposing a
motor bike, and you're sketching out plans for a space shuttle. Maybe I'm
not being visionary enough?

It seems to me that there's an old way of describing something, and many
possible new ways. The old way is with a set of characters with values
(states) applied to a set of taxa. This is the form of DELTA data, Lucid
data, textual descriptions (in a way). Updating our standard for this way
of describing is achievable now, I think.

New ways of describing something, such as with 3-D tomographic imaging etc,
may well be the way of the future. But I'm not sure that we can have one
descriptive standard that encompasses both old and new ways under one roof.
This is why we need extensibility - can we take an incremental step along
the lines that I'm proposing while allowing for the future brave new world.
Or can we have a set of linked standards - one for describing in the boring
old characters/states/taxa way, and others for the more space-shuttle ways
that can be linked in as they develop.

Looking forward to responses

Cheers - k

I agree completely concerning descriptors and creativity.

I think DELTA does need to be replaced because it's holding us back, not
moving us forward. This is happening for several reasons, one because it
was not created with extensibility in mind, the other because the DELTA
file format for storing descriptive data is intimately tied with one
particular program for manipulating descriptive data, and this is not good.
We need a truly flexible, extensible standard that belongs to the whole
community.

Many of the elements in my proposed document are not covered by DELTA. I
think we need them, and have found that waiting for the DELTA standard to
be changed is not adequate.

Cheers - k

Kevin,

I think the approach that Stan outlines in looking at specific relationships among
entities should make much of the complication, seem a bit less of an obstacle.  We
need to better understand the properties of our "data objects" and the various
ways they are associated.  If we define our vision too narrowly, and here is
perhaps where I would disagree with you and Stan, we will end up with a result
that may not be as general and flexible as we might need later.  We run the risk
that it will probably difficult to adapt to more complex relations.  However, I do
believe Stan is correct in that we need to first focus on the simplest relations
among entities.  This is probably a good idea for two reasons: 1) if we have
started with the right notion of "fundamental objects" at least some of their
interactions will be simple (also read general, ie less constrained), if we have
evaluated them correctly, and 2) simple relations will likely be more efficiently
implemented and at the core of our "hyperspace shuttle" (hyperbike?) we will
require efficiency, since the number of data sets and transformations are already
large.

If I understand the rationale for engaging in this exercise it is to permit users
to search, select and "interoperate" with a variety of different data types and
structures so that data mining and new insights can be gained.  I believe we agree
that we need more than a translator, but how much more, I believe, will remain
unclear until we have a better handle on exactly what properties these various
entities (features and data structures used to represent them) actually have.
This is not to say that studying carefully how specific translators may work (ie
Lucid to DELTA or reverse or Lucid to NEXUS, etc.) will not be informative for
ellucidating the generalities that are required.  On the contrarary, the approach
you suggest is quite a workable one and may well suffice for more limited ends.
My earlier comments were directed to permit the structure of the specifications to
extend to more general data types than we might be able to currently  envision.
I reiterate the general structure of the "standard descriptor language" should not
restrict progress along the lines you suggest, only that it would be useful adopt
a general approach that could subequently incorporate such extended
functionality.  I guess it stems from my need (hope) for mechanisms that will help
me integrate loosely structured text (in a web-based environment) and more
quantitative (operational) means of structuring data.

At the conceptual level, the notion of "character" is central to the dicussion of
what we mean by taxonomic information.  I believe we need to have a recomendation
for a specification that taxonomists/systematists can adopt to include the
"universe" of such characters, not that all are equal or equally important, or
utilized by a given implementation.  The recommendation probably also needs to be
simple enough that most can understand and use it.   Nonetheless, there appear to
be many different kinds of characters and here is where things start to get hard.
Some such as cladistic characters will have a basis of comparison that maps the
characters into specific disjoint character states.  Others will be mensural or
countable in nature, whose basis of comparison defines an axis of variation and
may or may not exhibit the property of disjunction (disjuction may be a property
of sampling).  In both cases they could be represented by a vector.  However, we
must understand the rules of accessing each element and whether or not specific
relations can be drawn from manipulation across vector types.  In the case of the
former they can be represented by text or by tags (ie state A vs. B, or 0 and
1).   The text used may be circumscribed via controled vocabularies to permit
analogy, if not direct comparision, with quantified characters (ie long vs short,
round vs square, etc).  Admittedly, this will be difficult because most biologists
often have used "local" reference frames when using free text in this way, rather
than any sort of "universally" applicable frame that we might be speaking about
for the first time here.  Consequently, "round" or "large" can have very different
meanings.  However, even here we can probably safely conclude that the
dimensionality of primary interest is 3D, at least when attempting to characterize
the size and shapes of features.

While the number of permutations may be extremely large, it may well be possible
to circumscribe characters with relatively few "tags", if we can define common
rules for the use of these "tags".   Perhaps the tags might define a
classification of characters (ie <qualitative character>, <quantitative
character>, in the former one may have <cladistic characters> and <general
qualitative> and among these <cladistic characters> might be further subdivided
<two state> or <multi-state> and the later may be tagged as <fully ordered> or
<partially ordered>, where as the former as well as the latter may also be tagged
as <directed> or <undirected>.  Similarly, cladistic characters will have other
properties that could likewise be tagged <name>,  <study used>, <basis of
comparison>, <textual description>, <date first proposed>, <represention of states
(ie 0's and 1's or some other tagging scheme)> some of which might have multiple
entries, such as <name (perhaps different for two different investigators, but the
same "character" nonetheless)> or <study used>.   Not all tags might get used.
However, if they are used, a standard must specifiy how they are to be used.

Characters also have other properites such as scale.  Although most informative in
a measured sense, (Angstroms, microns, millimeters, meters, and nanograms, grams,
kilograms, etc.), we would likely have to establish relations among a variety of
different kinds of reference scales (ie molecular, subcellular, cellular, tissue,
organ, organismal, ecosystem), which are variously defined in a broad array of
contexts.  Where possible, it would be useful to attempt to at least loosely
interoperate across such reference frames, say for purposes of a broad search.
Characters also have scope in that they are mapped onto organisms.  Consequently,
conventions are also necessary to circumscribe what we mean by taxon and how we
deal with issues of rank (and perhaps newer philosophies of "rankless"
classfication that seek to deprecate the concept of rank).  Although multiple
classifications and synonyms make both kinds of mapping complex, "standardized"
lists of names for molecules, structures, and taxa do exist that we can use to
simplify some of the complexity.  Characters also exist through time, but again
absolute scales are often wanting and we will likely need to deal with the period
of time in which a character exists (existed) in relation to relative reference
frames.  Obviously, in each case we require a means to specify the nature of the
standardization, much as XML names spaces attempt to deal with the potential
confounding of elements of the same "name").  Here it would be helpful to have a
"standard list of standard lists" so that we can begin to understand how ungainly
such an approach might actually be.  Some such as the geological reference scale
and ITIS names list are obvious candidates, but it would be nice begin to assemble
the URL's that we might have to visit to actually understand the details.

While not all implementations would need utilize all "implict" tags, specification
of the nestedness of a particular tagging scheme would require specification
(standardization).  Such an approach does lend itself nicely to parsing and to
object-oriented definition.  At the level of implementation, it would not be hard
to imaging for example Lucid or Delta passing their own internal representation to
the parser that uses the specification inherent in the internal representation to
wrap characters with (XML) tags that could then be either translated to other data
formats, or processed according to a previously specified search criteria or set
of processing instructions that might perform another kind of association, data
mining, or analysis.   Similarly, it would be relatively easy to take range data
from a given CAT scan or structured light range-sensor or graphical data gif or
jpg files and similarly tag (annotate) it so that particular features of the data
could be given "equivalent"  meaning for association with otherwise qualitative
data.  Admittedly, getting the machine to do the annotation remains, except in
limited circumstances, a dream for the heavens, and I too would just settle for a
"hyperbike" (with training wheels) at this stage in the development of "hyperspace
shuttle archicture".

Kevin's analogy is actually quite flattering to DELTA. In constrast to a
space shuttle, a bicycle is simple, affordable, robust, very efficient, and
usable by nearly anyone once they've had a bit of training (though
admittedly the training can be off-putting to the novice).

So I would suggest that before we consign the old bike to rust away in the
garage, we take a good long look at what we perceive to be its strengths
and weaknesses. It has, after all, served fairly reliably for over 20 years
- a remarkably long time in the data-processing field.

If I may be indulged, I'd like to quickly list a few of what I perceive to
be DELTA's strengths and weaknesses.

Perceived strengths:

1) Flexibility - the DELTA system is capable of encoding a large range of
character types, especially those traditionally used for identification and
classification. The system has been or is being used for encoding
descriptions of pottery as well as Poaceae; soils as well as spiders;
viruses as well as violets.

2) Large range of translations - this was really the impetus for the
initial development of DELTA. Once entered, data can be readily converted
into a variety of formats for usage by more specialized applications. Hence
data needs to be entered only once to generate natural language,
conventional keys, or interactive keys, or to perform phenetic or cladistic
analyses.

3) Efficiency - the format is very compact, yet is still human-readable. It
is relatively easy to parse - I know of parsers written independently in
Fortran, C++ (both from our CSIRO group), Pascal (Mauro Cavalcanti), and
Basic (Gregor Hagedorn's DeltaAccess), and I've even helped write one in Perl.

4) Internationalization - the format make it easy to prepare descriptions
and keys (conventional or interactive) in a variety of languages, without
having to re-enter data.

Perceived weaknesses:

1) Limited extensibility - although the DELTA format can be extended (see,
for example, the "proposed new features" document available at the DELTA
web site < http://www.biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/www/programs.htm >), most
extensions tend to be done on a rather ad hoc basis, and typically must be
done by program developers, rather than end users (that is, DELTA's
extensibility is perhaps analogous to that of HTML, rather than XML).

2) Need for new data types - several new types of information associated
with taxonomy and systematics have arisen in recent years, and which are
not well catered for in the current DELTA format. Notable examples include
sequence data, hyperlinks to related material in remote locations, and
links to other programs (e.g., bibliographic databases). Another aspect
might be the inclusion of meta-data (e.g., who recorded this observation,
and on what material?) While this sort of information can be placed into
DELTA "text" characters and comments (as could virtually anything
representable as a string of bytes, with a bit of effort), the use of text
characters does not provide for well-structured access to the information.

3) Poor support for hierarchies or classifications - the current DELTA
system offers little in the way of representing classifications of either
the taxa within the treatment, or of the characters used to describe those
taxa.

4) Doesn't use "industry standard" technology - because DELTA is a
special-purpose format, it is not possible to obtain off-the-shelf, general
purpose software which can understand the format. This restricts DELTA's
ability to interact with other programs (for example, those that might use
SQL queries, or make use of embedded objects).

5) Difficulty in merging or comparing datasets - it is rather difficult to
combine datasets based on differing character lists, even when those
character lists are fairly similar. There is no mechanism for "mapping"
character states from one dataset onto those of another. (Disparate
character lists are another matter entirely. My personal view is that the
holy grail of a "universal" character list for, say, all of botany will
tend to remain tantilizingly just out of reach, and the efforts of this
group should not be distracted in that direction.)

Well, that's a start. Others may wish to add to it. I hope that whatever
new model is developed can duplicate DELTA's strengths, but circumvent some
of the weaknesses.

My view is that an XML-based approach does offer hope for achieving these
goals. Like DELTA, XML somewhat bridges the gap between "document" and
"database", providing for great flexibility. Parsers and translators are
readily available, and XML is designed to be extensible. But getting the
design "right" is going to take a lot of thought and effort.

In 1993, we published proposals for enhancements to the DELTA format:

Dallwitz, M. J., Paine, T. A., and Zurcher, E. J. (1993). Preliminary
suggestions for new features for the DELTA system. DELTA Newsletter 9, 2-13.

Dallwitz, M. J., Paine, T. A. and Zurcher, E. J. (1993 onwards). Proposed
new features for the DELTA system. http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/

We have not received much feedback on these proposals, and none, as far as I
can remember, from Kevin or other members of the LucID team. None of the
proposals have yet been implemented in our software, so it is difficult to
see how being 'tied with one particular program' has hindered progress. On
the other hand, some of the proposals _have_ been implemented in LucID -
perhaps that's what's holding us back :-).

We are back to an issue that was raised earlier, so at the risk of
boring people by repetition, the way to record data is not (if at all
possible) as states, but as measurements.  Measurements of the same
character from different studies <underline>may</underline> then be
combinable, and states extracted from the measurements.  But if one is
combining states, then one is likely to be in trouble.  The "approved
shapes" that a committee of the Systematics Association came up with
some years back are fine for communication in descriptions and
conversations, but the best way to record shape data, whether for
phylogenetic analysis or deciding if one heap of specimens really is
distinct from another, is as measurements.


(I agree that a list of "approved" characters is probably not
attainable at present.)


This raises another issue that Eric mentioned:

This issue of metadata is very important: if a DNA sequence is linked
to a voucher, then all measurements/observations should be linked to
specimens.  In an "ideal" database, there would be links to specimens,
if only through a literature citation; not being able to make easy
links in the literature can make it difficult or impossible to use, and
not having such links in a database greatly reduces its value.  If I go
wrong in including a specimen in a particular taxon, I want to be able
to pull out all information associated with this specimen, whether it
is simply length of leaf blade or how the anther wall develops, when I
put it in its cotrrect place.

I must wholeheartedly agree with Peter here, he has put his finger on an extremely important concept.  The measurement vs. dimension-reducing-semantic-construction argument should be extended to geocoding as well.  This appeared as a given to me but I have recently reviewed yet another geographic coding scheme.  I think that we might even actually be able to agree on some standard measurements within groups, even if we can't agree on how we are each going to interpret them.

I agree with Eric on two points raised above:

- discrete characters / states need to be re-evaluated and perhaps re-coded
when they are combined across studies; automating that task isn't a good
idea (comments by Peter and Stinger about morphometrics notwithstanding --
though morphometric characters can also be very context specific).

- this group should not be distracted by developing lists of authorized
shape descriptors.

But Eric's comment reminds me that there is a STRONG reason for moving a
data set between the various applications that deal with descriptive
data:  a single person might want to use DELTA, LucID, PAUP and McClade in
the same study.  It would be "nice" to have the capability to create and
maintain a single data set that could store and "serve" data to each
application.  If we could create the specification for that data set, I
would judge this effort a success.

The issue of constructing mechanisms for mapping characters into one another
is quite different from attempting to circumscribe a language necessary to
describe all possible definitions of "character" so that rules governing their
description can be unambiguously applied.  One doesn't need "universal"
characters, only a usefully large "universe" of potential character
descriptors.  Properties of some classes of characters will be wholely
irrelevant to the characterization of others.  I would agree it would be
useless to search for such mechanisms that could be "universally applied".

Although I entirely agree with Peter, so few cladists actually measure the
objects to which they assign to state that one can safely conclude that
matching "characters" by their underlying measurment data would likely only
reference a very sparse matrix.  Quantiative characters are fundamentally
different than qualitative ones in large part because qualitative characters
are inherently more ambiguous and less constrained in terms of implicit
notions of "equivalence".

However, if one did want to associate features represented in widely different
formats, it would be helpful to have a data standard that could describe the
various kinds of associations that might be usefully employed and how they
might be related.  As Stan points out, the measurements actually taken are
often quite context sensitive and may even vary from one investigator to
another or from one method of measurment to another.  It would seem that one
would need to have a good description of exactly how the measurements were
taken, should either one want to repeat them or simply to understand what
measures exist and what they tell us.  However, other than that "caveat
emptor".

Nonetheless, despite numerous problems of correspondence, it would be
extremely useful to be able to use metadata consistently applied to tag two
different kinds of data (characters), both taken on the same organisms and
perhaps on the very same objects, so that they could be reevaluated.  Whether
the possible "remappings" could be made automatically, would largely depend on
how much ambiguity one could remove from the qualitative characterizations.
In my estimation, at present this could only be done for an extremely small
number of characters under special circumstances and consequently would not
now be of much interest to most.  However, newer data-rich acquisition
techniques continue to expand the number of features for which human-induced
ambiguity can be better excluded from the data.  Consequently, if our aim is
to develop a standard protocol able to describe and relate such data, as well
as more track and associate taxonomic data captured by more traditional
methods, it would be worthwhile to have a means to do this and not leave such
kinds of data out of the protocol, because they do not readily conform to
currently accepted paradigms (eg. characters in states always specified by 0
or 1, my least favorite approach, etc.).

It seems to me we need protocols for describing how multiple kinds of
characters can be referenced.   I think we need a reference model that permits
us to associate various kinds of metadata and not (necessarily) establish the
equivalence of specific character definitions.  For example, it would be
extremely helpful to be able to query the web oracle and ask "Please give me a
list of all the characters (names and descriptors) associated with veination
in taxa, X, Y, and Z"  or "what character systems have been used to establish
the propinquity of [ or simply describe' members of taxon A?"  If our lexicon
and grammar are inadequate for classifying some of these "characters", then
the list will always be incomplete and the reference model will be of limited
value.

Obviously, it would be nice (probably essential) if we can then translate from
different representations, but if this list is really only about translation
among different existing data formats, then perhaps conceptualization for a
more general reference model for representation of taxonomic data can be done
elsewhere [ :( ].

Nonetheless, I really don't think that in many cases one would want to
actually store the reference data  in a common format and then serve it.
Rather, because some forms of storage will be much more compact, and hence
more efficient to specific tasks, there would be often strong incentive to
keep data in its "native" format.  However, these representations would be
necessarily more arcane and probably not human readable.  Instead, I think it
would be more often useful to consider how one could specify how the native
format could be reformulated dynamically into a common "standard?" reference
format and then retranslated into another native format.  XLST is well suited
for this purpose.  If the "standard reference" involved "standard tagging"
then use of XML could provide a nice human readable format that might exist
"conceptually" or only briefly in memory during translation.  This would
require, however, understanding what kind of language (tags?) we  might
formulate to describe the common representations so that the translations are
correct when made.  This has three advantages that would be useful: 1) that
the "view" of the data can be separated from its inherent logic, 2) that
natives who like to use "native" languages need not become restless as a
result of our efforts, and 3) various "native" formats might die out simply
because other approaches are found more useful or new formats could emerge,
without impacting our ability to track and reference such data.  Of course, we
need to keep in mind that in taxonomy and systematics, generally when we refer
to character data, we are usually really referring to representations of data
rather than the data itself (ie values ultimately derived from some repeatable
measurement process).  For those who shun phenetics, where characters have a
quantiative meaning, the measurement process is largely implicit in the
resultant conceptualizations ("states").

If translation is required, then one might at a suitable place in the
descriptor structure/lexicon establish a means for specifying <character
encoding="DELTA"> or <character encoding="LucID"> etc.  Then let the processor
handle the rules required by the transform, at least to the extent the
inherent level of ambiguity allows.  The question is then what information is
needed by the processor to perform the specific requested transformation.
Seems to me we require at a minimum: 1) tag(s) identifying the character, 2)
specification(s?) of the character/data class (what kind of character/data is
it?), and 3) a means of informing the processor what its various properties
(ie states, ordering, values, etc.) are and how they are encoded.

Might detailed discussion of a few example characters permit us to better
understand exactly how these specific (target?) implementation handle
different kinds of characters and how they might be alternatively
represented?  This would give us a better idea of what kinds of "rules" we
require and in what circumstances one kind of representation might be more or
less ambiguous than another.

This is the raison d'etre of DELTA. To quote from the Introduction in the
User's Guide:

   When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs,
   the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a
   particular program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data
   that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use
   the data. ... The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was
   developed to overcome these problems. ... A format-conversion program,
   Confor, converts DELTA-format data into natural language, or into formats
   required by several other programs, including Key (generation of keys),
   Dist (generation of distance matrices), Paup, MacClade (Nexus), and
   Hennig86 (cladistic analysis), and Intkey (interactive identification and
   information retrieval).

In other words, DELTA was designed to be a single source for the descriptive
data required by a variety of applications. It still fulfils this function
better than other formats currently in use - see
http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/www/compdata.htm.

Producing such a specification, i.e. for a new 'superset' data format, was
one of the goals mentioned in the minutes of the last meeting of the
TDWG-SDD group. I agree with Stan that it is the most important goal, and
perhaps the discussion should start to focus more on it. Also, more progress
might be made if the initial effort were directed to the less controversial
and more achievable parts - perhaps a discussion and consolidation of the
features used by existing programs. The above-mentioned document might be a
starting point.

INTRODUCTION

I think that it's not particularly difficult to accommodate description,
identification, and phenetic or phylogenetic analysis in a single database.
Perhaps some of the people who have done or taught it would care to comment.

By 'not particularly difficult' I don't mean that it's easy, particularly
without the help of an experienced teacher. It's of comparable difficulty to
many other aspects of professional work, for which we usually prepare by
undertaking a degree course. Nor should we expect that advances in software
will ever make it easy, in the sense that it could be done well without
aptitude, training, thought, and experience. (In fact, software advances
often make tasks _more_ difficult, as greater capabilities lead to higher
expectations.)

In addition to the obvious benefits of making as much use as possible of
laboriously acquired data, there can be valuable synergies between the
different kinds of application. For example, even if the data are primarily
for phylogenetic analysis, using them for description and identification can
help detect errors. It is not unheard of for published work to contain gross
errors (such as frame shifts caused by the accidental deletion of matrix
elements) which could easily have been detected in this way. Also, the
information-retrieval functions of Intkey can help in exploring patterns and
relationships in the data.

DETAILED DISCUSSION - permission granted to stop reading here :-)

Within a given project, it's possible to define a 'universal' set of
characters which are suitable for all applications. To these can be added
characters designed for particular purposes, which are to be omitted for
other purposes. For example, classification characters (e.g. the family to
which a taxon belongs) and geographical distribution characters (what
countries, states, etc. a taxon occurs in) are useful in description and
identification, but would not normally be used in classification (for want
of a better word, I will use this as an abbreviation for 'phenetic and
phylogenetic analysis').

Sometimes it will be necessary to define alternative characters to represent
similar concepts for different purposes. Obviously, efforts should be made
to keep such alternative characters to a minimum. Software can help by
combining character states, converting numeric characters to multistate, and
checking the scoring of characters against relationships defined between
them (not done by any current software as far as I know, except for the
special case of character dependencies).

(An aside. While some 'identification' characters are unsuitable for
classification, the converse is not true. To claim that a 'classification'
character is not suitable for identification is tantamount to an admission
that the author's scoring of the character is not reproducible by others. Of
course, I am referring to interactive identification, using a program with a
'best characters' calculation fast enough to be used routinely, and
supporting character weights.)

With a given set of characters, it may be necessary to record attributes
(i.e. the cells of the taxa X characters 'matrix') in different ways for
different purposes. For example, in LucID it is possible to flag state
values as 'present by misinterpretation'. Values so flagged would normally
be used for identification but not for description.

Our proposed enhancements for the Delta format (see, for example,
http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/www/descdata.htm) contain more general
methods of flagging values for use in any number of user-defined
applications. For example, consider the coding

16,2/1<@only keys> 17,7<@only keys>-8.5-9<@for classification>-10-12<@only
keys> 18,2<@for classification>/3 20,1/2<@not Australia>

For the application 'keys', this would be interpreted as

   16,2/1 17,7-12 18,2/3 20,1/2

and for the application 'classification Australia' as

   16,2 17,9 18,2 20,1

It is often necessary to use alternative _wordings_ of characters for
different purposes. (This is different from the alternative character
_concepts_ discussed above.) This arises: (1) because of the different
contexts in which the words are used; (2) because of the different audiences
for whom the words are intended (e.g. different native language, different
knowledge of terminology).

The contexts in which the words appear range from full natural-language
descriptions, which may contain all the characters in their natural order,
supplemented by headings, to applications such as conventional keys in which
the characters appear in random order, completely out of the context of
their related characters. Intermediate cases are descriptions in which parts
are omitted because of: missing data; inapplicable characters; inclusion of
only a subset of the characters; or inclusion of only diagnostic attributes.
Other example of random order are: lists of 'best' characters in interactive
identification; displaying the attributes of a specimen in the order in
which they were entered; displaying diagnostic descriptions in the order in
which the characters were added.

Another requirement is an abbreviated form of the character for displaying
in applications, such as interactive identification, where characters must
be selected from a list. In DELTA, this is achieved by means of comments in
the 'feature' line of a character. For example, with the character
...#10. leaves <presence>/
        1. present/
        2. absent/
Intkey would display 'leaves (presence)' in character-selection lists, but a
natural-language description would read (say) 'leaves absent'.

It is often possible to meet the requirements of various contexts from a
single character list, though doing so may require some compromise - the
results for some purposes may not be optimal. For the best results, it may
be necessary to have alternative wordings. In the past, we have accommodated
this in DELTA simply by having separate character lists, and invoking the
appropriate one for different applications. This is inefficient, because a
large proportion of the words can usually be used in all applications. We
therefore want to move towards a single list, with groups of words flagged
for use in different applications or contexts. The same mechanism can be
used for different languages, and also in other text such as character
notes, and text in 'item' descriptions (text characters, and comments
associated with attributes). The syntax suggested for this in our Web
publications does not reflect our current preferences - I have not had time
to update these documents.

As a person who went from DELTA to PAUP and tried to come back again (after
much massaging of the data), I'd add that the transferrance needs to go both
ways -- after you port your data to PAUP/MacClade and massage it somewhat,
it would be nice to (relatively) painlessly come back to DELTA with those
changes rather than having to begin from scratch and then combine the two
data sets.

The program Nex2del, supplied with our DELTA programs, converts a Nexus data
matrix to DELTA format. Information will usually be lost in converting DELTA
to Nexus, so it's usually better to edit the data in DELTA format and
re-export to Nexus as necessary.

At 10:23 AM 25/7/00 -0500, Peter Stevens & Stinger commented on the hoary
issue of characters/states vs measurements:

It's completely true that a set of measurements is a more fundamental data
element than a character state. But we need to allow for both ways of
recording data, for two reasons. Firstly, some characters don't lend
themselves to measurement (e.g. indumentum - it would be possible but
hellishly difficult). Secondly, if I'm writing a key to Families, I'm
afraid I probably won't be recording measurements of individual specimens
very often, as the data blowout would be alarming. And what specimens would
I use? I see no way around the problem (for higher-order taxa at least) of
doing the collation of data (measurements->states) in my head, with all the
admitted problems that ensue.

The draft standard document I've put to the group allows for some
characters to be scored after a head-wise (hopefully wise, anyway)
collation, others to be collated from individual measurements using some
form of collation rule.

As to data attribution, the draft standard document allows (I hope) all
data elements to be attributed (to a specimen, taxon, literature citation,
person etc), but doesn't force the issue.

While I am philosophically most sympathetic to Peter's agruements, I must agree
with Kevin with regard to the need to distinguish measurements as "characters"
from qualitative characters.

The bases of comparison for the former are typically fundamentally different
with respect to asignment to state of the latter, and would be dependent not
only on the exact definition [criteria for recognition] of the endpoints, which
may differ systematically between investigators (or method of measurement), but
also with respect to temporal scope (ie some endpoints may not be identifiable,
except within a particular size range for a given structure in a given taxon).
As pointed out by Kevin, they would also be dependent on sampling, although one
would hope that most investigtors are atuned to the need to increase sample
sizes to avoid bias or mischaracterization.  With respect to measurements, the
bases of comparison are geometrically constrained, whereas qualitative
descriptions are not so constrained, even though both may be used to
characterize the "same" features.

Nonetheless, one could in some cases meaningfully tag measurements with some of
the same tags as qualitative characters to indicate that they are proxies for
the "same" features.  This would allow data matrices conforming to these
"generalized" features to be associated and the user able to then assess whether
the association is "sufficiently tight" to warrant regarding them as proxies for
the "same" feature.  The difficulty comes in consistently  applying/defining the
basis of comparison and in establishing criteria to recognize when constraints
imposed on using measurements create inconsistency with various qualitative
definitions of "state".  Perhaps attributes of a tag element could be used to
indicate  (hint at) different shades of meaning when measurements are associated
with qualitative states (eg <leaf character><measurement character
endpoint1="regionally localized,  endpoint1_precision=">>5%" endpoint2
="precisely localized" endpoint2precision="<<1%"> 45.2</measurement
character></leaf character>, or some such construction, where in this case,
<leaf character> may take the same tag name as might the qualitive character.
However, we may need to also include additional refining elements  <data
measured by>Peter Stevens</data measured by>Peter Stevens</data measured
by><data measured using>calipers</data measured using>, or some such to fully
relate fundamentally diffferent data types or qualify the measurement context.
In any event, such shades of meaning would require that "appropriate" context be
established and context could vary enormously depending on the features being
evaluated.   In image analysis, one of the reasons image algebra was developed
was to assist in standard charcterization (transformation) of images and image
fragments ("features").  However, this only works when there is a consistent
basis for comparison (typically pixel size and pixel neighborhood) that
underlies the sets being defined.  Unfortunately, (or perhaps fortunately) the
human vision system is vastly more variable and complex.

In the near term, Kevin is probably correct to suggest that the onus is on those
who would care to tackle the "hellish difficulties" of making such
associations.  It may be best to fork the dialog with regard to this point,
which is not to say that we shouldn't seek a general approach that could be
extended to include possible solutions to such  "issues of association" at a
later time (ie better establish a useful lexicon  and grammar for <mesurement
character> elements, as opposed to <qualitative character> elements).

Nonetheless, one of the unfortunate practices in systematics has been the
relegation of measurement data to "notebooks" or more recently "floppy/CD disks"
that are not properly archived in any coordinate fashion, except perhaps for the
duration of a study or some unspecified time after that, and often at best only
partially summarized in the original publication.  The discipline could be much,
much richer, if there were a consistent standard for archival and association
between measurement data and qualitative description, if for no other reason
than to recognize the various contexts within which these data might be useful
in the future, not to mention to encourage workers to let others know "exactly"
what they did to arrive at their conclusions.  Measurment data can be extremely
useful in providing insight into how different investigators actually recognize
the various states of their characters and may suggest why different
investigators may not recognize the same states for the "same" characters.

Dear List'eners

I don't want to push things, but it seems to me that the discussion's not
gaining much more focus that we had last time. I think mostly we're
reiterating and discussing the scope of the problem, and while this is
important and valid, we also need to move beyond this to specific attempts
at dealing with the problem. We're discussing the need for a standard
rather than actually creating one.

I put up a while ago an initial attempt at a proposal (the document DDST
Specifications.doc, you all will have this buried in your attachments
folder somewhere). Some people have looked at this, I know, but I think we
need to decide:

1. Is this a start, or is it the wrong way to proceed and should be ditched
in favour of something better
2. If it's an adequate start, what concrete changes are needed to
incorporate the ideas people are discussing?
3. If it should be ditched, can anyone produce a better draft specification
that we can build on.

I think at this stage we need a draft document around which the discussion
can focus. Contributions that point out complications and problems can then
make concrete suggestions as to changes to the draft proposal, rather than
be mere discussion points. It seems to me we should be at this stage around
now - we've discussed the problems for close on 12 months now.

Now it may be that the structure of this group is poorly suited for the
task, and a recommendation should go to TDWG that this isn't the way to
proceed. As it stands, it seems to me that we're functioning well as a
discussion group but not well as a working group (actually working on the
problem). This is undoubtedly partly because we're all busy - I know that
I'm doing all this in my "spare" time and I'm sure most of us are in the
same boat. Perhaps the only way that this can happen properly is for funds
to be sought to employ someone on a contract basis to turn the ideas raised
here into concrete output, using the list as an expert group/listening
post/scratch-pad resource or whatever. We need to be honest as to whether
we're going to achieve something.

Any idea?

Cheers - k

<b><font size=3D-1>Draft Specifications for a Descriptive
Data Standard for Taxonomy</font></b>
<p><font size=3D-1>Version History:</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Version 1.0 February 24, 2000, K.Thiele</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Version 1.1 revised July 18, 2000, K.Thiele</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>General Requirements</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>The DDST will be a data file structure that allows the
capture and management of all types of data required for describing the
morphology and anatomy of an organism or taxon. All data and metadata needed
will be stored in one file, structured into several blocks (character lists,
taxon lists, items data etc.).</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>One file will comprise one treatment, the basic unit of
which is one or more characters describing one or more taxa or=
 individuals.</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>The DDST will support the following:</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>External lexica: these are externally-referenced lists
of characters and states, or taxa, shared between several treatments. Lexica
may be used without modification, or with one or more characters, states
or taxa added internally (e.g. global vs local characters).</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Collation of data: data in the DDST may be captured and
managed at several levels. One treatment (see above for definition of=
 treatment)
may store descriptive data for individual specimens, another may store
data for species-level taxa, while another may store data for higher-level
taxa. These individual treatments may be linked into a nested hierarchy,
with specified collation rules allowing collation of data up the hierarchy,
and passing of data down the hierarchy. Thus, some characters in the=
 species-level
treatment may be scored directly in that treatment, while others will=
 collate
data (e.g. leaf measurements) from items in the specimen-level treatment.
Conversely, some characters may be scored in a genus-level treatment, and
these become implicitly true for all taxa in a linked species-level=
 treatment.</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Rich Attribution: all data elements in the DDST may be
fully attributed to a source (e.g. contributor, published reference,=
 specimen
etc). Attribution will be optional at any level. Attribution will allow
data-tracking and house-keepng, especially in circumstances when several
contributors work on one treatment.</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>The list of data elements below is structured using=
 tabbed
levels. Items tabbed across one level and enclosed in square parentheses
are replicable within the higher level.</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Items in <b>bold</b> are required within their level=
 (although
the higher-level structure to which they belong may not be required)</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Comments are in curly parentheses.</font>
<p><font size=3D-1>Note that this draft specification does not imply any
particular structure for the data file used. It should be read as a list
of required data elements for the final specification.</font><font=

<p><sup><font size=3D-1>1 Attribution and sources for an item datum overides
that for a character or taxon, which override that for the treatment as
a whole. Attribution for characters and taxa are equivalent and=

may contain data on specimens, a higher-level treatment on taxa. The=
 higher-level
treatment gathers information for some characters from lower-level=

<p><sup><font size=3D-1>5 The idea here is to specify a subset of taxa for

   Draft Specifications for a Descriptive Data Standard for Taxonomy

   Version History:

   Version 1.0 February 24, 2000, K.Thiele

   Version 1.1 revised July 18, 2000, K.Thiele

   General Requirements

   The DDST will be a data file structure that allows the capture and
   management of all types of data required for describing the morphology
   and anatomy of an organism or taxon. All data and metadata needed will
   be stored in one file, structured into several blocks (character
   lists, taxon lists, items data etc.).

   One file will comprise one treatment, the basic unit of which is one
   or more characters describing one or more taxa or individuals.

   The DDST will support the following:

   External lexica: these are externally-referenced lists of characters
   and states, or taxa, shared between several treatments. Lexica may be
   used without modification, or with one or more characters, states or
   taxa added internally (e.g. global vs local characters).

   Collation of data: data in the DDST may be captured and managed at
   several levels. One treatment (see above for definition of treatment)
   may store descriptive data for individual specimens, another may store
   data for species-level taxa, while another may store data for
   higher-level taxa. These individual treatments may be linked into a
   nested hierarchy, with specified collation rules allowing collation of
   data up the hierarchy, and passing of data down the hierarchy. Thus,
   some characters in the species-level treatment may be scored directly
   in that treatment, while others will collate data (e.g. leaf
   measurements) from items in the specimen-level treatment. Conversely,
   some characters may be scored in a genus-level treatment, and these
   become implicitly true for all taxa in a linked species-level
   treatment.

   Rich Attribution: all data elements in the DDST may be fully
   attributed to a source (e.g. contributor, published reference,
   specimen etc). Attribution will be optional at any level. Attribution
   will allow data-tracking and house-keepng, especially in circumstances
   when several contributors work on one treatment.

   The list of data elements below is structured using tabbed levels.
   Items tabbed across one level and enclosed in square parentheses are
   replicable within the higher level.

   Items in bold are required within their level (although the
   higher-level structure to which they belong may not be required)

   Comments are in curly parentheses.

   Note that this draft specification does not imply any particular
   structure for the data file used. It should be read as a list of
   required data elements for the final specification.

   1 Attribution and sources for an item datum overides that for a

   Attribution for characters and taxa are equivalent and additive.

   2 Treatments are nestable. That is, one treatment may contain data on
   specimens, a higher-level treatment on taxa. The higher-level
   treatment gathers information for some characters from lower-level
   treatments, using a specified collation rule. Collation rules will be
   specified externally to the treatment, and will cover e.g. how to
   merge scores, calculate values, deal with conflicts in source data etc

   3 Character names may be hierarchically nested. Character properties
   (e.g. sets, dependencies, attachments) are only specified for the
   lowest level characters.
   e.g.
       Leaves

   margins
       teeth

   orientation }only these have
       shape } properties

   4 Dependencies may be defined either up or down (but not both?). An up
   dependency lists the character states that make this character
   inapplicable; a down dependency lists characters that become
   inapplicable when this state is chosen.

   5 The idea here is to specify a subset of taxa for which this
   character is scored, or to specify that the character is non-global,
   then leave it to the parsing program to determine the taxon list. This
   feature would be used by future identification programs that employ
   the Progressive Revelation model.

   6 The item data may be stored as the equivalent of either a
   taxon-state matrix or a state-taxon matrix, depending upon whether
   taxa are nested within characters or characters are nested within
   taxa. There will need to be a way of specifying which of these is
   operative.

   7 Public Notes are available for parsing, Private Notes are not, and
   are designed for private housekeeping within the treatment

A couple of points.

With regard to footnote 1.

1 Attribution and sources for an item datum overides that for a character or
taxon, which override that for the treatment as a whole. Attribution for
characters and taxa are equivalent and additive.

Don't we also need to say that item data attribution at the specimen level
may override that for a character or taxon as a whole?  Otherwise, the system
has no way of dealing with misidentifications, particularly if some but not
all parts have been associated with the wrong ID, as might be frequently
encountered in fossils, or when dealing with taxa whose character state
definitions are later found applicable for only a specific size range (ie
differentially break down at small sizes).  Specimen or parts level
data/attributions also would presumably be additive, even if potentially
contradictory (subject to differences of opinion), would they not?

Statement:

One file will comprise one treatment, the basic unit of which is one or more
characters describing one or more taxa or individuals.

If we are to presume nested levels of groupings of descriptor elements, then
we need to be able to clearly distinguish data values that are regarded as
referring to "individual units" (specimen, species, higher level taxon) at
one level, but are "collective" when evaluated at a different level.  Not
only with the "collation rules" be different for different levels, but may be
different depending on whether a given feature (possibly "same feature but
defined differently") is regarded as a data item refering to a specific
"individual unit", or as a "collective unit".  That is, the data item is a
representation of data that might apply to a collection, rather than a
measurable value that may have a scope no larger than a specific measure of a
specific specimen.  Perhaps some treatments might include "collections of
collections" that would imply a mixing of both situations.

Seems to me we need a means of distinguishing  between collective
representations and "unit values" (for lack of a better word), if for no
other reason than to be able to track which data items apply to particular
"features of general interest" (eg. leaves, roots, head, foot, etc) and which
taxa are involved (higher-level taxon, species, individuals, parts of
individuals).  Its not clear to me how the current DDST can be used to
associate "basic units" that might be reasonably differentially defined at
different "levels of composition" by different investigators.  Perhaps we
need some general means to assign the "scope" over which the definitions of
"unit" apply.

I presume you mean
Specimen with ID - set of individual measurement or set of measurements
(say in mm.) all associated with this specimen (maybe at a particular
institution).

Specimens of species: grouped, a larger series of measurements, and/or
variously processed (e.g. mean + s.d.)

the measurement(s) of either the specimen or the species could be assigned
to states; those states might encompass a range of variation such that the
attributuion of a specimen/species to that state would mean that, when
refering to the state, one loses sight of the original measurements.

Yes. Actually I mean two things. The simple is that there is some data that
just is text and not processable but should still be in a treatment. For
example, Natural History comments or social factors like, "Native Americans
used this tree to construct canoes because they could." or some other more
useful comment.

I also mean that not all character states can be grounded in reality. I agree
with Peter that they _should_ but there is a lot of legacy data out there and
we don;t have the collation rules that were used by the authors to come up
with
the generalities. So we need to support the word "ovate" as a leaf shape
descriptor <leaf_shape>ovate</leaf_shape> or we will not be able to support
legacy data. Even if we do not really know what they meant by "ovate." I think
this can be covered in your standard document and in XML since we can define a
property for the tag to say how we got it. <leaf_shape type=text> or for
"grounded data" <leaf_shape type=collationRule|where-to-find-rule> or if the
leaf shape was for a specimen instance and described with an ellipsoid Fourier
descriptor <leaf_shape type=EFD>e1:0001;e2:0212;e3:0981</leaf_shape>

An application can define the semantics based on the type property (meta-data)
conversely we could make different leaf_shape tags for the different types but
I think that is a bad idea.

I have just finished reading all the traffic on TDWG-SSD after 2 weeks
away, and I noticed something interesting.  There is an important
difference of perspective here that has not so far been made explicit:

To some people, character definitions are part of the *structure* of
a data format, while to others these definitions are *content*.  E.g.,
character definitions as structure (attribution lost):

>> [...] So we need to support the word "ovate" as a leaf shape
>>descriptor <<leaf_shape>ovate<</leaf_shape> or we will not be able to
>>support legacy data.

...and as content (Peter Stevens):

Count me among those who regard character (and taxon) definitions as
content.

Quite!  I have always regarded this group as one dealing with structure and
until we are able to nail down this distinction and put the content to one
side for a short while, it is going to continue to be difficult to make
clear progress on the underlying structural issues...

In my humble opinion,
as many people have stated in this group, we need to put the actual content
issues aside to establish the standard. In the end we only really care about
sharing the content. The structure is just a means to enable sharing of
content. The point that I was trying to make about "ovate" is not that the
actual word "ovate" needs to be in the standard but that the descriptive
mechanisms of the standard should allow data types such as "ovate" to exist as
content and that the structure of the standard should be able to encode
information about the content to allow people or computer programs to make
decisions about the  use of the content.

The particular XML-like syntax is only as means of how that kind of
information
could be encoded in the structure.

Maybe if I ground this in Kevin's document I'll have a little better luck
trying to communicate.

---------------
The authors of an Angiosperm treatment standard might want to use the document
created by this group (BioSDD?) as a guideline for making their treatment
definition. As part of their definition may wish to create a Character  Name =
"Leaf Shape", with a Character dependency of "Leaves". They will need to
provide a Character State list for this Character. These states could take
many
forms.  The BioSDD should provide guidance on this form. There should be a
range of options of data types and processing to choose from (along of course
with the options of using something not included in the BioSDD). I am arguing
that the BioSDD should include data types and type qualifiers that are
different from and addition to the "Character type" in Kevin's document

"Character type {ordered multistate, unordered multistate etc} "

So you might say that a particular character like "leaf shape" in the
Angiosperm might have Character States that are assigned by "text", "collation
rule" or "Fourier descriptor". The Angiosperm standard authors might further
specify that vocabulary for character states of the text based state
descriptions. They might include "ovate", "oblong" and "round" in that list.
(This list would not be included in the BioSDD. The BioSDD would just say that
if you have a unordered unistate text field that you can provide a list to the
authors or leave the state values open to any text.) An author of a treatment
then might decide by ungrounded opinion that the leaves of the Waga oni plant
are "ovate". The author would record "ovate" and that it is of type "text" so
that not computer program will read it and try to treat it like a Fourier
descriptor.

I am sorry that I am having difficulty making this clear.

I might be way off base. There seem to be two issues related to this problem.
Should we allow a standard that flags these kinds of data and how can we
represent this type of functionality in the structure of the BioSDD guidelines
so that Angiosperm standard authors can easily use them.

now I need to get some work done.

Experience with contractors/consultants is that they require a fairly tight
specification of what they are being asked to build or you will end up with
a pedal-powered space shuttle, or worse.  We need to come up with the
specs, and having done that there will probably not be much for the
contractor to do.

Nailing the specs to the wall should be something that this group can be
able to do.  We have all developed specs, schemas, models, etc. at some
stage of our lives for our own enterprises.  All we have to do is reach
consensus on what this one might look like.  Hey - shouldn't be much more
difficult than herding cats or nailing jelly to a wall...  :)

And once we have the specs there may even be one or several among us who
will actually build something with it.

An item in the DDS is like an old OTU - it may be anything from a specimen
to a species to a Kingdom. In footnote 1 I'm trying to address the
relationships between attribution of the different possible sources of
data, not between different levels of the hierarchy.

That is, there may be an attribution for the treatment as a whole:

e.g. Data for this treatment, unless otherwise attributed, are derived from
the literature source Bloggs & Hogwash (1899)

But data for a particular character (for all OTUs) may come from a
different source:

e.g. Data for character 9 (presence or absence of the CAM photosynthetic
pathway) comes from the literature source Meg & Mog (1999)

and the attribution Meg & Mog 1999 will override the default attribution.

But data for a particular item (in this case a taxon that was not included
in Meg & Mog 1999) for character 9 comes from pers. obs.

The possibility of specimens being items comes from the ability to nest
treatments.

e.g. Treatment A comprises measurements of a series of specimens of
Imaginaria magica for some characters (e.g. hypopode length). Treatment B
comprises as its items species of Imaginaria. Some characters (e.g. CAM
metabolism) are scored directly in B while others (e.g. the range of
hypopode lengths) are collated from A.

Data for the character hypopode length in B would then be attributed to
treatment A, where each data element is attributed to measurements taken by
me on a specimen.  Redetermination of a specimen followed by rebuilding of
the treatment tree would allow the redetermination to be incorporated all
the way up.

Would this work, and does it address your query?

Surely the data level to which a character is attributed is determined by
the context of the treatment:

>referring to "individual units" (specimen, species, higher level taxon) at

The attribution of data for a collated character in B to "raw" data in A
provides the context: we know that the character in B is collated and hence
higher-level data than in A. Same goes for "collations of collations" - the
attribution allows you to track the data down to its source.

Or am I misinterpreting you?

Peter Stevens added:

A collation rule may derive a higher-order numeric from numeric data:

e.g. Treatment A stores hypopode lengths for specimens, Treatment B
collates a range (and/or mean, median etc) of hypopode lengths for a
species, Treatment C collates a higher-order range of lengths for a genus etc.

Another collation rule may convert low-order numeric data into a
higher-order multistate:

e.g. Treatment A stores leaf length, leaf width and distance to widest
point for specimens, Treatment B collates these into shapes for species,
Treatment C collates the shapes again, this time direct from treatment A
rather than bringing in the problems of collating a collation. (Note that
sometimes collating a collation may be acceptable e.g. determining the full
range of petal colours in a higher-level taxon, where the rules at all
levels are simple additive)

Thus, with both the collation rules and attribution at all levels fully
explicit, one should be able to track any data element to its source. Any
good, Peter?

This seem plausible to me.

The only complication that comes to mind is the situation where one might have
two inconsistent identifications of particular specimens.  How would the
redetermination rule work with respect to A if one has a Treatment C, say for
hypopode width, for which the ID for (some?) of the same specimens in A is
inconsistent with that used in treatement A?

If the inconsistency is based on soley a difference of combination (perhaps old
synonym incorrectly used) one could make the redetermination automatically (using
the nomenclaturally appropriate combination).  Otherwise, I'm not sure what flags
get raised since it would depend on the nature of the inconsistency.  Perhaps
just throw the data back to the user with an error message and let them make a
decision might be the appropriate response?  This could certainly aid in
identifying mistaken identifications, but in any event there probably needs to be
some kind of default logic once inconsistency in the data is located.  It will be
difficult to eliminate entirely.

I would agree.  I think its a question of to what extent we want the system to be
able to make (part of) the inference for us so that we can be aware of the
"universe" of features out there for which there are relevant data.  When the
data are initially recorded they are most likely defined within a much narrower
context.  I'm still struggling with how we can determine the extent to which the
rules might be constructed to determine (identify/establish) context.

My research group has finally been able to devote a couple of hours
together discussing the DDST V1.1 as it relates to the published treatments
of the Flora of North America and records that we are creating for the
EcoWatch Project. First, we quickly dismissed trying to fit FNA into the
spec since we ran into to many issues. We'll return to FNA another day but
we did decide that the PrairieWatch Butterflies of Illinois for EcoWatch
were much easier to deal with since we have full editorial control. So over
the next two weeks we'll be modifying the DTD for that project and working
up 20 or so example treatments (all at the species level.) We had some
immediate questions and comments even before we convert one treatment.

Treatment not equal to file:
The second paragraph of the General Requirements of the DDST v1.1 states
that "One file will comprise one treatment...". There is no reason to
require in the specification that a treatment = a file. This is because
there is good reason to synthesize XML treatments on the fly from databases
and allow users to query the XML structure to extract just the elements
that they need. Most of the proposed spec works fine it we say that "A
treatment is a structured presentation of information. The DDST provides a
uniform view of descriptive data for taxonomy but it does not specify the
underlying storage and representation of the information." We'll examples
of why I say this below.

Taxon Name:
We start right off with the Treatment Name. For the butterfly project at
least, the treatments are all about species. Is it reasonable to give each
treatment a name that equals the Taxon Name | Taxon ID? That is what we're
doing for now. In general, should the DDST include treatment naming
conventions linked to the Taxon ID? Of course you get into trouble if the
Taxon Name changes but you would be OK if the ID were kept constant.
So for now our treatments will have names like <Treatment Name>Papilio
polyxene</Treatment Name> but I am not happy with the decision. Any better
ideas out there? If so it would be helpful if those ideas were in the spec?
In our case the treatment name will also be a file name for now but
eventually parts will be in a database and we'll need a unique <Treatment ID>.

Description:
I think it is fine that there is a description element to the treatment but
we were confused about what should be being described; the taxon or really
the treatment. We decided that decided to take the spec at face value and
really include the treatment which is fairly boring. All our treatment
descriptions will be pretty much the same. <DESCRIPTION>This treatment was
created as part of the Biological Information Browsing Environment project
funded by NSF, UIUC... Information selected for the treatment is intended
to support tasks associated with the PrairieWatch project....</DESCRIPTION>
This uniformity makes me believe that many aspects in this description
should be removed from the treatment and moved "up" one level to a higher
order entity such as a collection of treatments or project. Several other
elements of the treatment format support that notion. It means that DDST
v1.1 is really a Treatment Spec. We also need a Collection Spec. This means
that the treatments should all have an element called the Project ID.

Treatment build/revision number
Treatment build/revision number is a really good idea and we all agreed
that we should have had it in our treatments before.
<TREATMENT REVISION>0.1</TREATMENT REVISION>
We use the 0 when the treatment is under development and not released yet.
I do not know how to deal with dynamic treatment build revision numbers.
Suggestions are welcome.

Contributors List:
Notice that if the information about collectors in the list such as contact
information is repeated in each treatment there is a data integrity
problem. People move. It might be possible that some treatments would have
one set of old contact information and not be updated while some treatments
might get updated information.

It should be that when a person requests a treatment in DDST v1.1 format
that they will get back a contributor list with ID, Name and Contact
Details but in most cases the system providing the information would insert
the contact information "on the fly". There does not seem to be a reason to
force the contributor IDs to be numeric as stated in the spec. Alpha
numeric can carry at least a little information to make the codes readable.
The current standard makes a relatively weak standard that the contributor
codes are unique to the treatment. I think we need to use a broader
definition. The should be unique to a collection at least. That way it
would be easy to find all treatments in a collection that a particular
person was a contributor for. Better if they were unique for the world but
that is more than this group can bite off I think.  DDST should at least
say that the Contributor ID is unique to a Collection.
For us we have

Suggestions?

List of Sources:
Again, usually the underlying information might be kept in different files
or databases but the view of a treatment would include the fields of the
spec. For us the spec will include bibliographic references and "personal
observations" Again is seems that source ID should at least be unique to an
entire collection, not just to the treatment.
<LIST OF SOURCES>

Actually in XML we don't need the <SOURCE LIST> but if is OK for now.

IMO a contributor would be a URN, that is a globally unique
identifier, and there would be catalogs at which the Contributor could
update contact information. In this case, the contact information
would be advisory only and contain the URL of the catalog service.
Typical URN's are email addresses or URL's (even when the latter don't
actually point to any actual web page.). The data might need to carry
or point to a clue that the URN's are only for disambiguation---they

Per above, the system could query the catalog for the
above info, but so could the requestor's software if the data server
identified the catalog URL and provided enough information for the
requesting software to make a request to the catalog. Among other
things, given the Contributer's URN it is even conceivable that the
requestor might be able to find more accurate contact information that
is available at the catalog the system consults.

For example, email addresses as URN's /usually/ will be very
meaningful and always unique.

They should be unique on a galactic scale at least.

Yech. Separate names into different elements for ease of
transformation, e.g. alphabetizing.

There must be existing XML mailing address standards around. Better to
use them to leverage any other software that also does.

A galactically unique id would be good here for similar reasons to
above, but might require a catalog to be useful. The publishing world
got it right with Cataloging In Press and having the publisher assign
the details of the ISBN. If all authors of new publications assigned a
URN, and somebody else assigned them to all pre-existing publications
in the galaxy ...

I don't think this needs to be in the spec. We're just following software
development practice that anything with a revision number less than 1.0 can
not be trusted.... Or is that anything less than 2.5?

Yes. We should grab that spec somewhere else too so that we do not need to
worry about details of how each culture orders names and titles.

I am very interested in this approach Bryan as we are design what might be
a similar thing in association with the Flora of Australia and the Virtual
Australian Herbarium for handling taxon-based descriptive information as
published without the character level atomization of Delta, LucID and
similar approaches.   I had not mentioned it before because I thought it
was a bit off topic for where this list is going.  But since you raise it...

The atomization of descriptive data elements is definitely the way to go,
but attempts to start databasing our Flora in the past have foundered
because the whole exercise gets too complicated too quickly.  Much like on
this list, people developed clinical universal standard character list
fixation syndrome and lost sight of forest, not for the trees, but for the
primary anadromy of subjuvenile leaf segments in taxon X  :)

We are now pursuing a compromise but hopefully achievable approach of
handling flora treatments as partially parsed 'blobs' at the taxon level
(where the most common levels are family, genus, species, infraspecies,
etc), with an XML schema that breaks things up into readily identifiable
elements from the published work - name author, reference, publication,
synonymy, description, figures, distribution, ecology, notes, keys, etc. -
without the need fro huge amounts of manual intervent, interpretation,
rescoring, etc.

Admittedly there are serious limitations to this approach, but we believe
it will serve a useful purpose while the world and SDD gets it act together
on a universal approach to descriptive data.  It looks like we will be
storing the data in our Oracle database and spewing it out via XML for
internet delivery and various publication options.  And a range of XML
tools are arriving that will enable us to pour marked up treatments
straight into the database.

Have not got time to reply in detail right now, but this weekend I will try
and tidy up some of our attempts at a data definition for the project and
post it to the list.

As indicated by Bob's response we are going to have to pay particular
attention not to reinvent standards and definitions that already exist out
there...  it will be helpfudl for us to be able to piggyback on what your
group is doing...

cheers

Hey, I wrote some software a few years ago, still in use, that I

Bryan - great!

| Treatment not equal to file:
| The second paragraph of the General Requirements of the DDST v1.1 states
| that "One file will comprise one treatment...". There is no reason to
| require in the specification that a treatment = a file. This is because
| there is good reason to synthesize XML treatments on the fly from
databases
| and allow users to query the XML structure to extract just the elements
| that they need. Most of the proposed spec works fine it we say that "A
| treatment is a structured presentation of information. The DDST provides a
| uniform view of descriptive data for taxonomy but it does not specify the
| underlying storage and representation of the information." We'll examples
| of why I say this below.
|
| Taxon Name:
| We start right off with the Treatment Name. For the butterfly project at
| least, the treatments are all about species. Is it reasonable to give each
| treatment a name that equals the Taxon Name | Taxon ID? That is what we're
| doing for now. In general, should the DDST include treatment naming
| conventions linked to the Taxon ID? Of course you get into trouble if the
| Taxon Name changes but you would be OK if the ID were kept constant.
| So for now our treatments will have names like <Treatment Name>Papilio
| polyxene</Treatment Name> but I am not happy with the decision. Any better
| ideas out there? If so it would be helpful if those ideas were in the
spec?
| In our case the treatment name will also be a file name for now but
| eventually parts will be in a database and we'll need a unique <Treatment
ID>.
|
| Description:
| I think it is fine that there is a description element to the treatment
but
| we were confused about what should be being described; the taxon or really
| the treatment. We decided that decided to take the spec at face value and
| really include the treatment which is fairly boring. All our treatment
| descriptions will be pretty much the same. <DESCRIPTION>This treatment was
| created as part of the Biological Information Browsing Environment project
| funded by NSF, UIUC... Information selected for the treatment is intended
| to support tasks associated with the PrairieWatch
project....</DESCRIPTION>
| This uniformity makes me believe that many aspects in this description
| should be removed from the treatment and moved "up" one level to a higher
| order entity such as a collection of treatments or project. Several other
| elements of the treatment format support that notion. It means that DDST
| v1.1 is really a Treatment Spec. We also need a Collection Spec. This
means
| that the treatments should all have an element called the Project ID.

This is getting places.

Perhaps I'm stuck still in the way Lucid and DELTA do things. There, a
treatment is not a description of one taxon, but a set of descriptions for a
set of taxa - e.g. all the species in genus X, or all the trees of Victoria.
This is because the treatment is viewed as having a definite objective or
product - storing data that will become an interactive key to the trees of
Victoria, or a set of natural-language descriptions of the species in genus
X.
You're handling it very differently, with each treatment the description of
one taxon, the treatments then bundled into a project defined (presumably)
by the objective. The advantage of this is being able to bundle individual
treatments in different ways (for different projects); the disadvantage is
having to make sure that such cross-bundling works - ie you may end up
bundling together several taxon treatments with different character lists.
Perhaps what you're calling a 'treatment' is actually the Item Data block of
the DDST, and what I call a treatment is what you're suggesting as a
project.
We need to sort this out.

| Treatment build/revision number
| Treatment build/revision number is a really good idea and we all agreed
| that we should have had it in our treatments before.
| <TREATMENT REVISION>0.1</TREATMENT REVISION>
| We use the 0 when the treatment is under development and not released yet.
| I do not know how to deal with dynamic treatment build revision numbers.
| Suggestions are welcome.

I think this should be up to the contributor not the spec. The general
guideline that <1 is work-in-progress doesn't really work, since all
treatments are and always will be works n progress. The only requirement
surely is that treatment numbers should increment - but perhaps then we
should just use the arrow of time and date-stamp?

| | Contributors List:
| Notice that if the information about collectors in the list such as
contact
| information is repeated in each treatment there is a data integrity
| problem. People move. It might be possible that some treatments would have
| one set of old contact information and not be updated while some
treatments
| might get updated information.

This will always be a problem if you try to attribute data to a movng object
such as a person. I see no way of getting around this. But presumably a
combination of the contact details and date stamps on treatments could be
used to track our wandering contributor?

| It should be that when a person requests a treatment in DDST v1.1 format
| that they will get back a contributor list with ID, Name and Contact
| Details but in most cases the system providing the information would
insert
| the contact information "on the fly". There does not seem to be a reason
to
| force the contributor IDs to be numeric as stated in the spec. Alpha
| numeric can carry at least a little information to make the codes

Yes, it could be done like this, but what would be wrong with doing it the

Sources and attributions need to be thought through more. I see attribution
as a reference to the person who actually encoded the data, and source as
reference to the data source as far back as it can be pushed. Source may
thus be a reference to a printed work, and attribution a reference to the
person who interpreted the meaning of that description into the format; or
source may be a reference to a specimen (or collection of specimens) and
attribution be a reference to the person who observed that specimen. The
critical thing is to have a hierarchy of ownership for both source and
attribution; thus, for one character the (default) source may be a printed
work, but for individual taxa the contributor may have referred back to
specimens and this should be an overriding source.

We try to teach programming students that their abstractions should
not forclose the use of data and code in presently unforseen
applications. Software developers should never be permitted to utter
"Why would anyone want to do X?" for any value of X. (FWIW, the most
common bugs in languages such as C which do not do type checking arise
from buffer overruns because a programmer said something like "Why
would anyone ever want more than 256 <something> ? "

As I frequently rave, this is an argument in favor of object
oriented data representations, which are ipso-fact
self-describing. XML is a simple way to accomplish this, but so are
object oriented databases such as Object Store and its
competitors. The book by Abiteboul et al. "Data on the Web"
describes---albeit sometimes with some deep theory---how one can
combine data whose objects have different descriptions.

Consistency of character lists across taxon could be handled by the document
type definition for that taxon class (or some other mechanism if we do not use
XML in the end) for a collection of taxon descriptions. The dtd defines what
can go into the treatments and how they may be combined.

Yes, perhaps there are really two different fields
Treatment creation time and revision number. I think time alone is not enough
since one can not tell from that if the treatment has changed since it was
last
viewed or used (to create higher level treatments).

It is conceivable that different systems (servers) might have various, slighly
different versions of the constructional software running on them that could, at
least in principle, produce two different version numbers even when
"simultaneously" generating elements of the same document (treatment?).

Don't we need to keep in mind that both "collections [attributable to a unique
source?]" and "treatments [virtual collections generated from multiple sources
with respect to specific <processing> instructions?]" [or visa versa?]  may be
dynamic in distributed environments?

I too remain unsure how the concepts and scope of terms "treatment" and
"document" and "collection" are being used (defined) as this discussion emerges.
It might be useful for us to maintain a glossary, perhaps with qualifiers (ie
sensu Bryan or sensu Kevin, etc), as such issues arise.  We can then at least
know whether we agree/disagree with respect to what definitions required or with
respect to how the definitions are used.

What I am concerned about with the revision number is easing processing for
www
spiders and for composite documents created from lower level
documents/treatments. www spiders search the network for new documents to
index. If the documents are dynamically created "on demand", they are in some
way different every time the spider looks, if nothing else because the
"creation date" will change to always be now. We need something more stable
like editorial date... the last time a qualified human said the record was OK.

The same problem exists for higher level taxon descriptions that are created
from lower level descriptions. There was a short thread about this a while ago
on this list. A good feature of dynamic creation of the descriptions is that
when a low level detail changes the higher level summary information also
automatically changes. The "oops, that specimen was actually a different
species" syndrome, may cause a character state recording some value to change
(because the outlier was recognized as another species.)  We do not want to
have to recalculate and verify all atomic facts whenever someone looks at a
high level description. We do want to regenerate summary information when
something changes... We can know that something has changed when the revision
number on a fact does not match.

Wow, what a pile of trouble for a little feature!

I do not know what to do about defining "treatment", "document", "collection"
and "project". I am willing to adopt any one else's definitions. The key point
is that there are actually different things that need to be treated
differently
some how.

Just a comment:
I was recently told by an expert in this field that documents build on the
fly are usually not indexed by WWW search engines and one had to have a
stable document in place as well to be seen out there.

This is generally true, mostly because those engines have no
particular way to construct a query that will induce the creation of
the page.

However, /other/ software, such as that which attempts to combine the
data from several sources, may well wish to know which of those sources=

is more recent, whether cached data previously obtained from a source
is stale, etc. For this reason, both a date (GMT of course) and
revision number are useful. Ideally, these would be of very fine
granularity, e.g. down to the field, but minimally they would be on
the record. If you don't do them on the field it becomes more
complicated to decide whether a datum from one database is more recent
than that from another:

Source 1 Record A: Item1(Jan 01, 2000) Item2(Feb 01, 2000)
Source 2 Record B: Item1(Feb 15, 2000) Item2(Jan 15, 2000)

Record B was modified later than Record A, but the datum in A-2 is the
more current Item2. Revision numbers are not useful across sources
unless the sources have a common revision number pool, which requires
distributed revision control.

Yes.  Each "atomic element" must have a "date last modified [by authority]"
attribute for the reason you suggest.

However, would not the spec also need to require that the "spider", or
specifically those processing instructions that define the "behavior" or result
set produced by the spider or other collation [transformation] programs
(methods), also leave a distinguishing revision number in the document so that
one can determine what specific method was used?  One might expect different
behaviors even for slight changes to the processing (compilation) code used to
assemble the consitutent [atomic] elements of the document to influence the
document content.

Even though there may be transient lack of availability of some distributed
resources (perhaps due to network failure, loss of a particular server, server
load, etc.] , the behavior of the "spider" also could influence the document
content [atomic element inclusion], albeit independently.  This would be an issue
for "higher level" associations (documents) that are created by automatically
assembling other "documents" that are themselves constructed from "atomic
elements".  Consequently, requiring the "spider" [read element inclusion
processing instructions] to leave an identifying mark in the document would
provide an ability to distinguish the source of the potential differences in the
final dynamic document.

Yes, I fully agree that the lower [atomic] level of detail must force changes at
higher more associative/inclusive levels precisely for the reason you suggest.

However, within an environment where the data may be distributed there may be
sources of error that may be generated when "key" atomic elements are not found
(server load to great, network failure, etc) or perhaps only older versions can
be located (only mirrors available, unflushed cache, etc).  Consequently, to
assess the logic needed to [possibly further] process or interpret a document's
contents would it not be useful to also have a means to pass knowledge of what
methods were used to assemble the document?    Presumably, the behaviors of the
processing instructions (document generating methods) will influence the
circumstances under which some kinds of atomic element processing instructions
(methods) will fail while others may succeed, say in making subsequent changes
"automatically" or "recognizing" the existence of another species.

Don't we need a spec that includes [requires?] a means to pass knowledge about
the kinds of associations that were made to generate the document, as well as the
lower level "atomic elements"and their attribution, if we are to avoid
recalculation to fundamental atomic level at each stage in the transformation
(document building) process?  If documents were characterized in XML, this could
make it much easier to chain XML transformations by faciliating the recognition
of what order of transformations were permissible.  This could also greatly
simplify the modification of processor (method) behavior and the
development/maintenance of efficient interprocess communication. A document that
was validated by successfully being transformed at one lower level of processing
to another by a given method, would not require revalidation at these "lower
levels" when being transformed to the next "higher" level by another method.
Presumably, such tags could be scattered at widely different levels within the
document, indicating scope of the document over which specific transformations
were relevant.

These issues are separate from the kinds of errors that may result when a method
encounters "atomic elements" that are internally inconsistent, within a
distributed processing environment.  So far we've avoided how to handle this
separate issue within the spec.  I don't have an answer except perhaps simply
requiring everyone to agree :-) or specifying the kinds of errors that should be
generated under such conditions.

Perhaps others may suggest a better/alternate approach to address these aspects
of dynamic document generation/transformation within the spec.

Thats fine by me as long as we can communicate which ones we're using.

That is correct. Generic web spiders would not know what parameters to send=
 to
a site to generate pages. Custom spiders do not have this problem.
The other solution is to have the site refresh its html files whenever a

is made to the underlying data or every night if it needs it or not.=20

I was thinking the document type definition would specify a method for
generating a field. Kevin had an example of calculating a mean or something
like that. That does mean that there need to be a set of predefined methods
for
value calculation and collection but I do not think that we need to be
exhaustive in the spec. The spec can just say that you should identify your
method. If it is all object oriented as Bob suggests it might be real
executable code. I think that is too much to ask for the first rev of the spec
but it should be an option. As Stuart suggests, the resulting value generated
by a method at a particular time needs to be tagged with information about
when
and how it was generated. The attribution fields might do part of that.

Right. This is complex. Any CS doctoral students out there looking for a
dissertation? Just kidding! It is not that bad. Well, if we make simplifying
assumptions it is not that bad. For rev 1.0 we should skip it but I can think
of an easy case to test. We could include a common name list in the butterfly
records from itis*ca. That list could be manually generated at first. By
"manually", I mean have the contributor search itis and type the results by
hand into the treatment. Later we can have the system query itis for XML that
can be inserted directly (or transformed first) into the treatment,
on-the-fly.
We'll see how the method tracking issue shakes out on the real example.

Perhaps we should just report processing errors somewhere. All calculated
fields have comment fields already. Perhaps there should be exception fields
too that in most cases will be empty. Again, this is a bell or whistle that is
not needed to get "something" running.

This email may just show my naivety, but:

All this discussion about how to accommodate web spiders and their inability
to trigger cascading builds of treatments brings to mind two recent
discussions outside TDWG - maybe there will be a solution here. It seems to
me that there is a problem if we constrain our development to using
off-the-shelf web systems rather than create our own.

1. If we ever get this standard thang resolved, can we create our own web
spiders with the characteristics we need (e.g. some knowledge of the
standard wrt version numbering etc, and the ability to interact with a
treatment to trigger events). If this were possible, we wouldn't need to
rely on standard search sites (Altavista etc) but could have our own search
engine with reports from our own spiders. The standard would include a tag
to make it identifiable to the spider. This may be a big job, but surely big
is what GBIF is all about. David Yeates (University of Queensland
entomologist) and I some time ago were toying with this idea. We called it
the BioScape, being a view of Web content tailored for biologists.

2. At a recent NSF/ARC-funded meeting at Manassas near Washington, a group
of Australians working in bioinformatics and their American counterparts
(inc. Bryan Heidorn, Jim Croft, Stuart Poss) discussed some of the big
questions and impediments in the field, and opportunities for collaboration.
In the descriptive data part of that meeting we developed the idea of a
Taxonomic Workbench, created by a New Taxonomy Collective (this lacks only a
manifesto, but that could be arranged). The TW would be a site that
taxonomists log onto to do their magic, including capturing, storing,
sharing and manipulating descriptions. It would be furnished with server-app
tools for these jobs. The gene jockeys have analogues of such a workbench
for their work, and these are very successful.

Our still-pre-incipient standard would be an important part of this. Again,
developing the TW would be a big a big job, but if such a thing is necessary
to make it work, then so be it. We would need to report this to TDWG, and
boldy go forth.

Cheers - k

Some recent relevant discussion (on XML-DEV) regarding the marking up of
names
[1,2,3,4,5,6] (Personally I like the format proposed by John Cowan, see
[4]).

[...]

> There must be existing XML mailing address standards around. Better to

These are good points - it is certainly worth looking around to re-use
'standard'
markup conventions where posssible. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative [7]
may
be one useful resource here. For example they specify qualifiers for
some elements (e.g. creator/contributor) [8, 9] which allow identification
of name,
affiliation, etc.

Even if the exact markup is not used, there are usually useful lessons to be
learnt.

--

There has been some discussion regarding producing an XML version of the
current
discussion proposal. Alongside this issues such as version numbering, date
last
modified, descriptive text, etc. These can be viewed as metadata describing
the markup. There are some XML 'patterns' which relate to this area [10,
11].

The XML patterns site [12] is an excellent resource for information on
defining
good XML document types.

--

I've become increasingly convinced lately that the RDF model [13, 14 (useful
introduction)] may be useful in this
context. For those who are not familiar with RDF it essentially allows one
to make
assertions about particular objects; expressed as 'triples'.

e.g. socrates is a man, the leaf is ovate.

Still mulling this one over...

New Draft Descriptive Data Standard Specification

Kevin Thiele
September 1, 2000

Introduction

The basic unit (atom) of a description is a statement of the form "For =
item x, element y has Value z"

e.g.
"Gouania exilis flower colour is green" or
"Joe Blogg's eye colour is blue"

In some cases, the statement needs to be qualified:

"Gouania australiana flower colour is yellow (rarely)"

Any description can be represented by a series of such statements. That =
is, a group of such statements comprises a description. In this draft =
specification one or more descriptions are represented by a set of =
statements comprising a document.=20

An example structure is shown in Fig. 1. A simple description would =
comprise a set of statements for one item (e.g. the taxon Gouania =
exilis). There is no requirement that these statements be structured - =
they may comprise a simple list.

Statements in a document may also be contained within a collection. The =
purpose of a collection is to allow properties of the statement and its =
parts (item and element) to be designated once only, rather than for =
every statement, and to allow statements about several items or elements =
to be contained within one document. A collection may comprise a set of =
statements about one item (e.g. the collection for Gouania australiana), =
or for one element (e.g. statements describing the element Flower Colour =
for several taxa).

The general structure is given in Fig. 2. The parts of the description =
(Item, Element, Statement) and the document each have properties. Some =
of these properties, particularly high-level ones relating to the =
document as a whole, may be recorded in only one place within the =
document (but see External Resources below). For example, the Document =
property Version No. clearly may only be recorded for the document. =
Other properties, particularly lower-level ones, may be moved higher in =
the document for efficiency (so that they only need to be specified =
once). For example, the Item property Name may be placed as a property =
of a collection. All statements in the collection then take that name =
property. Or it may be placed as a property of the document as a whole, =
in which case all statements in the document take that name property.

Attribution and sources

The Attribution and Reference properties are special cases. The standard =
is designed to allow (but not require) very rich attribution and =
referencing of statements. Attribution here means assigning one or more =
authors to a statement or set of statements ("Jane Taxonomist is the =
person who has recorded here that Gouania exilis flowers are green"). A =
reference points to a published document or other source for the =
statement, such as a set of specimens or observations ("The statement =
that Gouania exilis flowers are green is derived from Suessenguth's Das =
Pflanzenreich", or "... is based on examination of specimens in the Kew =
Herbarium"). Attributions and references may be specified for a =
statement, or for an item or element when these are defined at =
collection level or higher, for a collection or for the whole document. =
Attributions and references specified at a lower level override ones =
specified at a higher level.

For example, a reference (Suessenguth's Das Pflanzenreich) and =
attribution (Jane Taxonomist) may be specified at the document level. =
Another reference and attribution may be made for a collection of =
statements, and these will override the reference and attribution =
specified for the document as a whole. Yet another reference and =
attribution may be specified for a particular statement, and this will =
override all others. If no attribution and reference are specified at =
one level, they are derived from the first specified at a higher level. =
Note that statements may be anonymous if there is no attribution, and =
unreferenced if there is no reference, specified for the statement or =
for any higher level.

External resources

Properties for a document need not be specified within the document. =
They may be specified in an external document, and referred to (with a =
suitable pointer) within the document. The document that contains the =
externally-referenced properties may or may not have its own statements.

External referencing will allow documents to share properties, reducing =
the need to specify the same properties many times over. It will allow =
the evolution of shared name-spaces etc, while not requiring it - a =
document may be part of a set that shares properties or it may be =
self-reliant.

Collation of values

Documents or collections of statements within documents may be specified =
as the source of data for particular statements. For instance, document =
D1 may contain statements about specimens of Gouania, document D2 may =
contain statements about species of Gouania, while document D3 may =
contain statements about the genus Gouania. Some statements about =
Gouania exilis in D2 (e.g. statements about the element Flower colour) =
may be stated explicitly in that document, while others (e.g. statements =
about the element Leaf length may be collated from Leaf length =
statements made in D1. Similarly, some statements about Gouania may be =
made explicitly in the D3, while others may be collated from information =
held in D2 (or D1).

Collation rules (e.g. "find the global range" or "list all values") will =
be needed to describe how the collation is to be done.

        This has a list of attributions (people to whom statements can be =
attributed); each statement is attributed. Note that a statement with no =
attribution would be attributed to the Principal (default) Attribution =
as specified. If the document had a collection, the collection could be =
attributed also. Attributions are ranked: an attribution for a statement =
will override one for a collection, which overrides one for a document

<B><I><P>New Draft Descriptive Data Standard Specification</P>
</B></I><FONT SIZE=3D2><P>Kevin Thiele</P>
<P>September 1, 2000</P>
<I><P>Introduction</P>
</I><P>The basic unit (atom) of a description is a statement of the form =
"For item x, element y has Value z"</P>
<P>e.g.</P>
<P>"<I>Gouania exilis</I> flower colour is green" or</P>
<P>"Joe Blogg=92s eye colour is blue"</P>
<P>In some cases, the statement needs to be qualified:</P>
<P>"<I>Gouania australiana</I> flower colour is yellow (rarely)"</P>
<P>Any description can be represented by a series of such statements. =
That is, a group of such statements comprises a description. In this =
draft specification one or more descriptions are represented by a set of =
statements comprising a document. </P>
<P>An example structure is shown in Fig. 1. A simple description would =
comprise a set of statements for one item (e.g. the taxon <I>Gouania =
exilis</I>). There is no requirement that these statements be structured =
- they may comprise a simple list.</P>
<P>Statements in a document may also be contained within a collection. =
The purpose of a collection is to allow properties of the statement and =
its parts (item and element) to be designated once only, rather than for =
every statement, and to allow statements about several items or elements =
to be contained within one document. A collection may comprise a set of =
statements about one item (e.g. the collection for <I>Gouania =
australiana</I>), or for one element (e.g. statements describing the =
element Flower Colour for several taxa).</P>
<P>The general structure is given in Fig. 2. The parts of the =
description (Item, Element, Statement) and the document each have =
properties. Some of these properties, particularly high-level ones =
relating to the document as a whole, may be recorded in only one place =
within the document (but see <I>External Resources</I> below). For =
example, the Document property <I>Version No.</I> clearly may only be =
recorded for the document. Other properties, particularly lower-level =
ones, may be moved higher in the document for efficiency (so that they =
only need to be specified once). For example, the Item property =
<I>Name</I> may be placed as a property of a collection. All statements =
in the collection then take that name property. Or it may be placed as a =
property of the document as a whole, in which case all statements in the =
document take that name property.</P>
<I><P>Attribution and sources</P>
</I><P>The <I>Attribution</I> and <I>Reference</I> properties are =
special cases. The standard is designed to allow (but not require) very =
rich attribution and referencing of statements. Attribution here means =
assigning one or more authors to a statement or set of statements ("Jane =
Taxonomist is the person who has recorded here that <I>Gouania =
exilis</I> flowers are green"). A reference points to a published =
document or other source for the statement, such as a set of specimens =
or observations ("The statement that <I>Gouania exilis</I> flowers are =
green is derived from Suessenguth=92s <I>Das Pflanzenreich</I>", or "... =
is based on examination of specimens in the Kew Herbarium"). =
Attributions and references may be specified for a statement, or for an =
item or element when these are defined at collection level or higher, =
for a collection or for the whole document. Attributions and references =
specified at a lower level override ones specified at a higher =
level.</P>
<P>For example, a reference (Suessenguth=92s <I>Das Pflanzenreich</I>) =
and attribution (Jane Taxonomist) may be specified at the document =
level. Another reference and attribution may be made for a collection of =
statements, and these will override the reference and attribution =
specified for the document as a whole. Yet another reference and =
attribution may be specified for a particular statement, and this will =
override all others. If no attribution and reference are specified at =
one level, they are derived from the first specified at a higher level. =
Note that statements may be anonymous if there is no attribution, and =
unreferenced if there is no reference, specified for the statement or =
for any higher level.</P>
<I><P>External resources</P>
</I><P>Properties for a document need not be specified within the =
document. They may be specified in an external document, and referred to =
(with a suitable pointer) within the document. The document that =
contains the externally-referenced properties may or may not have its =
own statements.</P>
<P>External referencing will allow documents to share properties, =
reducing the need to specify the same properties many times over. It =
will allow the evolution of shared name-spaces etc, while not requiring =
it - a document may be part of a set that shares properties or it may be =
self-reliant.</P>
<I><P>Collation of values</P>
</I><P>Documents or collections of statements within documents may be =
specified as the source of data for particular statements. For instance, =
document D1 may contain statements about specimens of <I>Gouania</I>, =
document D2 may contain statements about species of <I>Gouania</I>, =
while document D3 may contain statements about the genus <I>Gouania</I>. =
Some statements about <I>Gouania exilis</I> in D2 (e.g. statements about =
the element <I>Flower colour</I>) may be stated explicitly in that =
document, while others (e.g. statements about the element <I>Leaf =
length</I> may be collated from <I>Leaf length</I> statements made in =
D1. Similarly, some statements about <I>Gouania</I> may be made =
explicitly in the D3, while others may be collated from information held =
in D2 (or D1).</P>
<P>Collation rules (e.g. "find the global range" or "list all values") =
will be needed to describe how the collation is to be done.</P>

I haven't read the spec or commentary yet, but only looked at your
example. It may be that the spec excludes this, but I would rather see
a <STATEMENT> be allowed multiple <ELEMENT> elements thus:

        <STATEMENT>
                <ITEM>
                        <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>
                </ITEM>
                <ELEMENT>
                        <ELEMENT_NAME> Flower colour </ELEMENT_NAME>
                </ELEMENT>
                <VALUE> green </VALUE>
                <QUALIFIER> rarely </QUALIFIER>

                <ELEMENT>
                        <ELEMENT_NAME> Petal shape </ELEMENT_NAME>
                </ELEMENT>
                <VALUE> ovate </VALUE>

        </STATEMENT>

Even more readable is the use of attributes

  <STATEMENT>
    <ITEM name="Gouania exilis" />
    <ELEMENT element_name="Flower colour" value="green" qualifier="rarely" />
    <ELEMENT element_name="Petal shape" value="ovate" />
  </STATEMENT>

In XML the difference between using attributes and using content as
you did is usually a matter of style. There are some subtle and one
not so subtle differences though: an attribute name must be unique in
an XML element. You can't have
   <ELEMENT element_name="location"
     value="Costa Rica" value="New Zealand" />

so if you need two locations you have to use content

   <ELEMENT element_name="location">Costa Rica</ELEMENT>
   <ELEMENT element_name="location">New Zealand</ELEMENT>

or else prescribe a list syntax, e.g. separator based
   <ELEMENT element_name="locations" value="Costa Rica | New Zealand" />


Yet more readable might be to make the element_name's value be the
attribute, at least when the element_name is a traditional character:
  <STATEMENT>
    <ITEM name="Gouania exilis" />
    <ELEMENT flower_colour="green" qualifier="rarely" />
    <ELEMENT petal_shape="ovate" />
    <ELEMENT locations="Costa Rica | New Zealand" />
  <STATEMENT>

This can be somewhat simplified by putting all the characters as
attribute on a single ELEMENT where reasonable.

Using a list syntax imposes parsing requirements (for the list) on the
application beyond those that will be provided by an XML parser and
the headache is probably not worth the parsimony obtained.

Kevin has offered us not just 1, but 4, different document models for
comment. That's a lot to consider, and I won't attempt to offer detailed
criticism on each alternative. But from my point of view, the first several
appear far too "weak" to be of much use. In particular, I think it is
essential that there be a mechanism for specifying a universe of the
character and state values (or, mapping roughly from Kevin's terminology,
"elements" and "values", respectively) which may appear within a
description. That is, we need to be able to define (or, rather, provide a
mechanism for the dataset designer to define) the equivalent of a DELTA
"character list". This is needed to enforce consistency and to disallow
nonsensical constructs. For example, a portion of Document 1 reads:

        <STATEMENT>
                <ITEM>
                        <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>
                </ITEM>
                <ELEMENT>
                        <ELEMENT_NAME> Flower colour </ELEMENT_NAME>
                </ELEMENT>
                <VALUE> green </VALUE>
                <QUALIFIER> rarely </QUALIFIER>
        </STATEMENT>

There needs to be a way to preclude a nonsensical entry like:

        <STATEMENT>
                <ITEM>
                        <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>
                </ITEM>
                <ELEMENT>
                        <ELEMENT_NAME> Flour colur </ELEMENT_NAME>
                </ELEMENT>
                <VALUE> Puerto Rico </VALUE>
                <QUALIFIER> anchovies, please! </QUALIFIER>
        </STATEMENT>


I might also note that I strongly question the way the above is organized.
I think a rearrangement better expressing the relationships (but still not
really addressing the problem of a lack of meaningful validation) would be
more along the lines of:

        <ITEM>
           <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>
           <ELEMENT>
              <ELEMENT_NAME> Flower colour </ELEMENT_NAME>
              <VALUE> green
                <QUALIFIER> rarely </QUALIFIER>
              </VALUE>
           </ELEMENT>
        </ITEM>

And I'd be inclined to make a bit more use of attributes, rather than
element content, though as Bob Morris points out, that is largely (though
not entirely) a matter of stylistic convention.

I don't really see any great difficulties is implementing some sort of
"character list" within the XML syntax. "Document 4" appears to be heading
in that direction, but doesn't (in my opinion) go quite far enough. What I
think we need is a Schema definition that would allow a validating parser
to detect obvious data errors, and assist editing software in enforcing
"correctness" of the data. I've recently been looking through the
description of XML Schema, and it seems to have the expressive power needed
for this sort of thing.

Plant descriptive data is much to complex to be captured in XML which is
more geared towards presentation than representation.

I'll second that.  I use LaTeX, and previously used a precursor to SGML,
to typeset all my printed documents.  These *typesetting* languages are
great for defining the appearance of the content of documents, but they
are utterly inadequate for representing the content (ie., data) itself.

For an example of how to present (think about) the relationships within
taxonomic datasets, see Appendix A of the manual for BIOTA.  IIRC, the
PANDORA website at www.rbge.org.uk may aveso has some diagrams relating
to this problem.

XML is *not* a typesetting language. Its a meta-language for defining other
languages,
just as SGML was. It is *not* limited to describing documents, and its far
from being a limited to describing layout.

My own doodlings with XML and Taxonomic data [1] shows that the DELTA
format can be expressed as XML without loss of information.

Its probably too early to get mired in syntax discussions - at present it
may be better to assume that all examples merely that - not formal
proposals for how the serialised data should look.

The model is the important issue at the moment. Once that is nearing
completion,
decisions on a serialisation syntax (XML or something else) can then be
made in highlight of concrete examples and data.

Personally speaking, I'd be surprised if there were aspects of a taxonomic
data model which *couldn't* be adequately expressed in XML. At most
I'd expect there to be some contortions in the syntax, rather than a
complete
inability to represent the data. The question is then, how much does the
syntactic
'sugar' outweigh the network effect of embracing a standard like XML.

My 2p.

This is not my understanding at all...

I thought the theory behind XML was to describe content, structure and
relationships of data elements, quite independently of presentation as with
typesetting languages...

Having defined an issue with XML, or similar, you can present it however
you want...

Having defined an issue with a typesetting language, all you can do is
typeset it...

One would do this only if one decided that XML and its associated
languages did not have enough expressive power to solve the problem
at hand. If it does, not using it is to abandon LOTS of existing
tools for parsing, transformation, presentation, data exchange and
data entry.

This is a good goal for system architects, but I doubt that treatment
representation will be the enabling technology for it. Rather only it
must not preclude it. What taxonomists mean by a treatment is too
narrow to be the sole support for what non-taxonomists, especially
non-biologists, need from computer systems about organisms.

Treatment data is only part of the knowledge that an
author of, say, a field guide, must represent in the guide, or that is
needed by projects as ambitious as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(www.gbif.org), or many of the numerous efforts with intersecting
goals (http://www.gbif.org/relafram.htm).

Here's an example that can not(?) be represented in what Kevin is
attempting, nor does it belong there: Some years ago on a rural road
in upstate New York, I passed a litter of fox cubs who---at the likely
cost of their own lives---would not leave
their mother as she lay dying in the middle of the road, obviously hit
by a car. There is a lot of important behavioral and ecological
information encompassed in that scene: the age of the cubs; the
rearing habits of the species; the impact of roads on
populations; etc. etc. None of this matters to a taxonomist (well,
maybe a little. Probably one can deduce from the behavior that foxes
are mammals).

Kevin's effort, and TDWG's charter, is foremost about data in the
service of knowledge, rather than knowledge in the service of
users. As such, his effort supports the system builders, especially
those with a desire to exchange or federate data or (one hopes) to
build extensible systems.

This is the last thing one would do if one believes---as I do---that
computer scientists should be building tools that /free/ biologists
from computer science specialists rather than indenture biologists to
computer scientists. Were it truly necessary, it would be analogous to
advice to consult with automotive engineers, physicists and organic
chemists before you buy a car.

I don't believe this. XML in particular and semi-structured data in
general can support schema inference (See especially the literature
referenced in  "Data on the Web : From Relations to Semistructured Data
and Xml" (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems) -- Serge
Abiteboul, et al; 2000). This alone probably disproves your claim.


 > more geared towards presentation than representation.

Ummm.... unless these terms mean something different in the Knowledge
Representation field than in the Document Management field, this is
the opposite of what most people believe:

  "Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
  logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
  the storage layout and logical structure."
      Sec. 1(Origin and Goals) of the XML1.0 Recommendation
      http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-origin-goals

So much is the desire to separate presentation that only a small part
of XSL, the XML Style Sheet language, addresses it (Section 6,
"Formatting Objects", http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/slice6.html#fo-section)

In general, neither Kevin's goals nor XML impose any presentation or
other semantics at all. That's good, because it leaves knowledge
representation to the application builder---who one hopes has lots of
help from biologists, all of whom are smarter than software.

Jim, I think your definition of a typesetting language is not the same
as mine.  If by "typesetting language" you mean RTF, then I would agree
with you that XML is not a typesetting language.  But I don't consider
RTF to be a typesetting language because it cannot (to my knowledge) be
used to write other languages.  That's the important difference between
RTF and XML (and LaTeX).

LaTeX is a language that was designed for typesetting, and it is good at
it:  typesetting is relatively painless, using LaTeX.  LaTeX can be (and
has been) used to write simple text-based user interfaces, and to write
new programs (yes, you can write LaTeX programs to write LaTeX programs,
ad infinitum;  you could also write LaTeX programs to write C programs,
and vice versa).  These other uses of LaTeX are quite contorted, though;
such programs are not pleasant to write.

GML was a markup language, like RTF; SGML and its derivatives, including
XML, are (as I see it) typesetting languages.

Sure, if we all agree with Leigh Dodd that we are just using XML for the
convenience of it (though I don't personally find XML convenient), that's
okay.  But the discussion here keeps slipping into implementation issues
and forgetting about the underlying abstractions.  We could conduct this
discussion in PERL code too.  (Hey, why not?)  Why not forget the codes
(or pseudo codes) and use ordinary words that we all understand?  *Then*
decide which language (if any) to implement it in, *after* we all agree
what "it" is.

files such as Lucid and DELTA use. I'm not sure why, but I like the idea
that the most basic document would simply say "Eric Zurcher has two feet".
Perhaps current programs wouldn't be able to make much use of such a
document, but maybe in the future we may have a way of collecting and
organising clouds of such basic scraps (atoms) of description into something
quite
powerful.

|                 <QUALIFIER> rarely </QUALIFIER>
|         </STATEMENT>
|
| There needs to be a way to preclude a nonsensical entry like:

|         <STATEMENT>
|                 <ITEM>
|                         <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>

|         </STATEMENT>

Yes, I agree. Validation rules need to be built in. I think I said that I
was putting this up for development, not as a finished product.

Perhaps another reason for having character & taxon lists at the head of the
document is to allow an agent that visits the document to determine which
taxa and characters it's about without having to parse the whole thing?

| I might also note that I strongly question the way the above is organized.

|            <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>
|            <ELEMENT>
|               <ELEMENT_NAME> Flower colour </ELEMENT_NAME>
|               <VALUE> green

|               </VALUE>
|            </ELEMENT>
|         </ITEM>

This is perhaps a subtle point, perhaps a trivial one, and I'm glad you
raised it. Why is this better that the above? What exactly is the advantage?
I know yours is more DELTA-like and I agree it seems more intuitively
correct, but is there more to your strong belief than that? In truth, I
played with different ways of structuring unitary statements and presented
the one I did to draw comment rather than just follow down the path of what
we do already.

Very likely. My opinion is that we should work out our data requirements
(one of which is the need for validation as you properly point out) and then
determine the best vehicle to carry the data.

Following several comments from the list:

Any and all comments about the syntax in my document and examples: I SHOULD
have said that I'm not trying to make this "proper" XML yet. My intention is
just to determine the data elements needed - it seems to me that once we've
done that the best-practice XML (e.g. should this data element be content or
attribute) can be done by you people with the knowledge to do it properly.

So please read anything that looks like XML in the examples as pseudo-XML.
Perhaps there's a better way of writing the examples to make it clear
they're not supposed to be XML yet. I'm sure I'm going to regret not having
done this.

Eric,

I'm not sure about a requirement for strong validation in the spec. I agree
that validation should be allowed, but not required.

Your example:

|         <STATEMENT>
|                 <ITEM>
|                         <ITEM_NAME> Gouania exilis </ITEM NAME>
|                 </ITEM>
|                 <ELEMENT>
|                         <ELEMENT_NAME> Flour colur </ELEMENT_NAME>
|                 </ELEMENT>
|                 <VALUE> Puerto Rico </VALUE>
|                 <QUALIFIER> anchovies, please! </QUALIFIER>
|         </STATEMENT>

There are three types of validation you suggest here:

1. Validate the element strings (and presumably also items, values and
qualifiers) against predefined lists to guard against typographical and
spelling errors;
2. Validate values against a list of allowable values for the character;
3. Validate qualifiers against a list of allowable qualifiers.

Taking these in reverse order:

3. As I see it the spec itself would define a set of allowable qualifiers
(such as "rare" (= "rarely"?), "by misinterpretation", "uncertain" etc). I
think we could probably agree on a limited set of qualifiers, and stick to
that (with allowance for extension). If we do this, then "anchovies,
please!" will be out for several reasons.

2. Validation of allowable values is covered in the draft spec. One of the
properties of an element (~"character") is a list of allowable values
(~"states"). If such a property is filled, then validation can be done by
the program that handles the data, just as in DELTA and Lucid.

Two notes:
* I'd like to allow but not enforce that a valid document have the
allowable_values property filled. By not enforcing it, a simply marked-up
natural-language description could be a valid document. This would perhaps
mean that the spec could meet half-way the automated markup of legacy
descriptions, and I'm keen to do this. Of course, a document without this
property specified would not be able to be validated in the way you suggest
and hence may not be very useful for some purposes, but this may be a price
one is willing to pay for other benefits, and I think we need to keep this
open.
* I'm using "allowable values" rather than "states" as this seems to me to
be more general, and subsumes the requirement to distinguish between, for
instance, multistate and numeric "characters". A numeric "character" of
course, doesn't have "states", but it does have allowable values (integers
in the case of an integer numeric, real numbers in the case of a real
numeric).

1. How strong is the requirement for this type of validation? Enforcing this
seems to me to be like requiring that all word documents carry in their
header a dictionary of the english language to allow validation of
spellings. It seems to me that providing tools that allow people to check
these strings against a predefined list (defined either within the document
or in an external resource) would be useful, but not absolutely necessary. A
document that is not or cannot be validated in this way would not be
useless, and would perhaps be more free.

Note that the spec as I see it would allow (but again, not enforce as DELTA
and Lucid do) the encoding of descriptions. Thus, a valid document may be d1
as below. This would preempt the need for typographic validation, and allow
allowable-values validation. But for some reason I don't want to disallow d2
as a valid document also.

But isn't that the main (only?) reason for bothering to encode descriptive
data in the first place?  To try and impose a degree of consistency,
rigour, comparability  and validity that is not possible in an
unstructured, unformatted blob of text?   If the specifications are not
going to require this degree of strandardization, are we going to be
letting the tansferability of data and effort that we seek slip by?

The value of the DELTA, Lucid and other character-based encoding of
descriptive data is that they do impose a high degree of validation,
whether it be by measurement ranges, allowable values or states, or
whatever.  Without validation in biological datasets you end up with a mess

This is the mechanism to addressing the above...

It would be nice to put a cap on the number/type of 'qualifiers' allowed,
but you can bet that there will always be something on a list that people
will want/need to use, but at this stage we probaly should confine ouselve
to the need for the list itself, not to the content of the list?

in theory yes, but in practice, if you open this can of worms, the

It is not just 'allowed', isn't it?  Isn't this what the draft specs are
all about?

It would be pretty difficult to validate a blob of free text...  but I can
see a case for wanting to include them in the exercise...  so perhaps there
should be a deprecated class of elements that are essentially unable to be
validated but perhaps of interest in some instances?

This would cover the use of text rather than various numeric values - there
is nothing that should say everything as to be represented numerically.  It
should be possible to use text *and* to have it validated in some way.

Documents do not have to carry their validation with them - they could
refer to an external source of validation (or dictionary in your above
example - this is what is implied and expected in Word documents at the moment)

This may be a non threatening approach to gradually introducing validity

I agree that there should be the capability to do strong validation but as
Jim stated below there are times when "free" text is appropriate in a
taxonomic
description. I'll go farther than Jim however and say free text fields are
not only
interesting for discussion but necessary elements of the standard.
If we do not allow at least some free text in the descriptions then the
standard will not be applicable to many worthy endeavors where it would be
of great
use. The matter hinges on the type of taxonomic descriptions that we want the
standard to cover. We should discuss some of them.

Since there was a little confusion about what is meant by text I'll
distinguish between
two types. Controlled Text comes from a controlled vocabulary. It is
proscribed like
the controlled vocabularies used in libraries for indexing. "Free text" is
just words in the wild.
It can be anything that the writer intends including anchovies. For
example, Kevin has argued that
the qualifiers should come from a controlled and therefor validatable
vocabulary.

Two Types of Taxonomic Description: (not even a little exhaustive but
certainly exhausting)

Certainly the first type of taxonomic description is one that is used by
computer identification systems like IntKey and Lucid. For this type of
taxonomic
description we need strong type checking and validation. It would need
controlled
vocabularies, no anchovies for qualifiers, numeric checking, range checking...

The second type of description is an entry from a field guide to
butterflies of the
arctic. It is mostly intended for direct human consumption without much prior
chewing by a computer. Even in this case there might be good reason to
allow the field guide entry to follow the standard. For example, assuming
that the
field guide is on-line we might want to do some name validation and
indexing in the
Global Taxonomic Workbench. Also, even field guides have keys sometimes.
We shouldn't just ignore interesting text like "The wood of this tree makes
wonderful canoes." I do not mean that we should have a <Canoe-Quality>
character.
We'll never be able to capture everything in characters.

There is certainly a substantial middle ground in types. For example the first
document type, the key matrix data, might be run through a program to produce
at least acceptable natural language descriptions. This has proven useful
for some
projects using Delta. Like Delta we'll need to allow "holes" in the
validation so that
we can include text to make things a little more readable for us humans.

Perhaps the standard could have a suggested set or two but require that
is qualifiers are used that they be from a project managed controlled
vocabulary. This is a little like Z39.50 allowing different attribute sets but
still being a standard. I did say a _Little_ like Z39.50.

We can validate existence if not content. I should be able to say that all
of my
descriptions will have <natural history> notes and maybe <medical uses>
in regular old natural language. If I set up my project standard correctly
under SDD
my validator should scream is an author tries to send in a manuscript
without that
section, even if the computer can not read the text. Also computer programs
processing the text should be able to tell what section they are in. For
example
people should be able to search just <Medical uses> section for the word
"eye".
If you can not do that you might end up with a list of all creatures with
eyes and not
medicines for your own eye.

Finally, there is free text in legacy data. It is reasonable to write computer
programs that process this data and "mark-up" interesting things at least
weakly
following the standard. We might be able to have programs find the Latin name,
common names, authority, bibliography and other useful things and tag them for
future use.It would be impossible however to make programs that convey the
entire
contents of these free text documents into the highly structured
"interactive key"
quality data sets.

I would like to see a "Free Text" character type in the standard and warn
authors
that they can not use it for characters that they want to process through
interactive key programs.

Right, systems work this way now. We could store the standard the a
description is
supposed to follow anywhere in the world. At the beginning of the document
place text
saying where to find it.
<SDD Version 1.10 http://global.taxonomy.org/SDD1.1/ Gouania >

This is so true and has dogged this list ever since it started - at this

That is what I am waiting for...  XML seems to be a fairly intuitive
contemporary way of describing things and it seems to be a reasonable thing
to use for the time being...  Remember our very first attempts to do it in
EBNF?  Same idea, different language, but at the time, I do not think many
of us were aware of what we were trying to achieve...  This was a graphic
example of an idea probably being right, but if people can not understand
and embrace it, it will not get anywhere...

Still not 100% sure what 'it' is, but I think with the most recent
discussions we are getting closer...

I think there's a difference between the spec defining allowable qualifiers
and defining allowable values for allowable characters (the old name-space
or lexicon chestnut). I've argued strongly in the past against the latter,
but I do think the former is tractable.

We need to remember that 99.99999% of all the descriptive data in the world
has not been validated except by error-prone humans. I think the bulk of the
endeavour of the last few centuries is still a pretty valuable resource.

Exactly. A document that is validated against an external resource is more
valuable than one not validated. That makes the validated document more
valuable, but it doesn't make the non-validated one value-less (if that were
the case Jim all your emails, with their liberal sprinkling of typos, would
be worthless!)

Jims and Bryan's comments are exactly where we want to be at the moment,
methinks.

I've realised over the weekend, thinking about Eric Zurcher's criticisms,
what it is I'm trying to do with Draft Spec Mark 2 (some people are a bit
slow).

In Lucid and DELTA we enforce a great deal of structure on the data file:

*CHARACTER LIST
#1. Distribution by State (or known provenance)/
       1. South Australia - south-eastern (south of the line from Port
Augusta
          to Broken Hill)/
       2. New South Wales (including Jervis Bay - A.C.T.)/
       3. Australian Capital Territory/
       4. Victoria/
       5. Tasmania/
...etc

If the * or the # or a / is left off or put in the wrong place, the whole
thing falls over. Only one very narrowly constrained data format can be a
valid file. This is primarily done for ease of processing, and was a
perfectly reasonable constraint for DELTA and Lucid to enforce, since what
they were trying to do was create a data file for their particular program.

The standard I'm working towards ALLOWS this degree of formality, but
doesn't ENFORCE it. In the standard, for a file to be valid input for Lucid
or DELTA, it would need to conform to higher-order structure as imposed by
those programs. But not all descriptive data out there is in DELTA or Lucid
format, as Bryan notes, and we need to be inclusive of other types of data
as well (by far the majority of which is natural-language legacy data). If
all descriptive data needs to be encoded to a strong specification, it will
never be so encoded (that's one reason, I think, why DELTA has failed as a
global specification).

So I'm trying to create a spec where both this:

<DOCUMENT Name = "d1">

 <ITEM_PROPERTIES>
  <ITEM ID = "1" NAME = "Gouania exilis"/>
  <ITEM ID = "2" NAME = "Gouania australiana"/>
 </ITEM_PROPERTIES>

 <ELEMENT_PROPERTIES>
  <ELEMENT ID = "1" >
   <ELEMENT_NAME> Flower colour <\ELEMENT NAME>
   <VALUE_LIST>
    <VALUE ID = "1">
     <VALUE_NAME> "green" </VALUE_NAME>
    </VALUE>
    <VALUE ID = "2">
     <VALUE_NAME> "yellow" </VALUE_NAME>
    </VALUE>
   </VALUE_LIST>
   </ELEMENT>
 </ELEMENT_PROPERTIES>

 <DESCRIPTION Name = "Gouania exilis">
  <ELEMENT>
   <ELEMENT_ID> 1 </ELEMENT_ID>
  </ELEMENT>
  <VALUE_ID> 1 </VALUE_ID>
  <QUALIFIER> rarely </QUALIFIER>
 </DESCRIPTION>

</DOCUMENT>

... and this ...

<DOCUMENT Name = "d2">

Viola eminens K. Thiele & Prober, sp. nov.

<DESCRIPTION Name = "Viola eminens">
<ELEMENT = "Longevity"> <VALUE>Perennial</VALUE> </ELEMENT> <ELEMENT = "Life
form"> <VALUE> herb </VALUE> </ELEMENT> spreading by stolons; rootstock
sometimes somewhat swollen and bulbous at the stem bases. Stems contracted
so that the leaves form rosettes, never elongate with caulescent leaves.
<ELEMENT Name = "Leaves">Leaves <ELEMENT Name = "lamina"><ELEMENT Name =
"Shape"><VALUE>broad-reniform</VALUE></ELEMENT>, the largest (10-)12-15(-25)
mm long, (20-)25-35(-45) mm wide, 1.5-3.2 times wider than long, usually
with a broad basal sinus; lamina with 9-20 +/- prominent teeth, glabrous or

bright green </ELEMENT>; petioles 2-8 cm long; stipules narrowly triangular,
usually with several small, glandular teeth on each side.</ELEMENT>
.........etc
</DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

are valid documents.

Now there's a lot of blob text in d2, but it's still a description, and
surely the very simple markup has value-added enormously to it. If we find
this document through a web search we at least know that it includes a
description of Viola eminens, and that this description includes a statement
about the life form of that species. This is a huge advance on only knowing
that we've found a document that contains the words "Viola" and "eminens".
Isn't that what XML is all about?

Further, it seems it me that imposing the most basic formalities only (that
a description is about something, that it starts at <DESCRIPTION> and ends
with </DESCRIPTION>, and that it may optionally include some structured
statements of the form <ELEMENT></ELEMENT> etc) can actually surprisingly
easily allow parts at least of d2 to be mapped (or reformatted) to d1 (once
we've got the syntax right which isn't yet the case with d1 and d2, he
hastens to add).

It seems to me that creating a standard like this would be more valuable
than simply XMLifying the DELTA of Lucid data file structure.

So that's what I'm trying to do, I think.

In DELTA, character values in a description can't be separated from the
'attribute' which contains them, without losing information. This is because
the order of the values, and the words 'or', 'and', and 'to' which may
connect them, are significant. Also, the position of a qualifier (before or
after a value) may be significant, and some qualifiers, e.g. 'reliability',
may apply to the attribute as a whole rather than to a particular value.

Example:

   5,3/3&1<when infected with virus>/<occasionally>2<@reliability 3>

 = Flowers red, or red and white (when infected with virus), or
   occasionally yellow.

This doesn't seem to be accommodated in the proposal - at least, it's not
spelled out.

Well, perhaps. But I think that our successors will appreciate it if we
apply a bit of rigour and take care to describe our data with as much
clarity and lack of ambiguity as possible. I don't think they'd find the
statement "Eric Zurcher has two feet" to be particularly interesting or
even unambiguous. Is "two feet" an anatomical statement, or a measurement
(e.g., has two feet of figurative rope, by which he can easily hang himself
in a forum such as this), or both <G>?

I think there is a real difference in terms of a reduction in ambiguity. We
should generally make an effort to clearly associate modifiers with the
object that they are intended to modify. Suppose we have something like the
following:

<ELEMENT>
  <ELEMENT_NAME> leaf </ELEMENT_NAME>
  <VALUE>
     lobed margins
  </VALUE>
  <VALUE>
     with spines
  </VALUE>
  <QUALIFIER>
    rarely
  </QUALIFER>
</ELEMENT>

How should such a construct be interpretted? Do spines cover the leaf as a
whole, or are they confined to the lobed margins? Is it the spines which
are rarely present, or the lobed margins?

I agree with Eric on this one...  in the example below, there is nothing in
the structure to say where the qualifier belongs...  If you read the data
sequentially you might have a pretty good guess,  but a specification that
relies on sequence rather than the structural relationships and clear
(explicit?) definitions of components for sense and meaning, is an bit

Exactly. Relying on ordering in the document is very shaky (CSV vs. XML).
Far better to explicitly define how (and to what) the qualifier should be
applied.

This could perhaps be handled by statements about statements.

i.e. a. leaf has lobed margins
     b. leaf has lobed margins with spines
     c. b is rare

(I believe this is known as reification in RDF. The relationship between
two objects can itself be modelled as an object, and thus properties
can be attached to it, and additional statements made about it)

Just musing...

Although I think I understand and like what we are trying to do I am having
a slight problem here...  a standard that does not enforce itself, is not
really a standard, is it?

It seems we are after a specification that says:

'a) This is how you describe the bits of organisms, and thus the whole
organism.'
'b) If you wish not to describe organisms this way, you can, but in that
case, this is how you must do it.'

I can live with that as a standard...

The DELTA spec would probably allow you to include a complete description
as a lump of text, but it would not be particularly useful to do so, and I
do not think Mike, Toni and Eric would be terribly impressed to see you
using DELTA this way...  :)

Yes, as long as it can accommodate all the complexities, rigour and
validation that is inherent in the DELTA and Lucid like data structures.

The last few days of discussion have seemed to be drifting towards a
'free' structure which would not enforce comparablity.  I totally support
Jim that one of the key elements in DELTA format is the absolute
enforcement of parallelism and compatibility.  The idea that each species
or specimen in a genus could be a separate document is anathema to me.  I
want rigor and compability in descriptions, keys, and data, not a retreat
to the chaos of the past.

This is a problem but an easy one (I think). In natural language
adjectives, adverbs and the like have a scope defined by the grammar that
we learn as children... or are born with but we will not get into THAT
here. In any case the qualifier modifier modifies the value of the
character, not the character as a whole. So in the standard, any value
should optionally be able to be qualified by placing the qualifier marker
in the scope of the value marker.
If we intend the spines to be rare not
<ELEMENT_NAME> leaf </ELEMENT_NAME>
   <VALUE>
      lobed margins
   </VALUE>
   <VALUE>
      with spines
   </VALUE>
*   <QUALIFIER>
     rarely
   </QUALIFER>
</ELEMENT>

but,

<ELEMENT_NAME> leaf </ELEMENT_NAME>
   <VALUE>
      lobed margins
   </VALUE>
   <VALUE>
      with spines
    <QUALIFIER>
     rarely
   </QUALIFER>
  </VALUE>
</ELEMENT>

order would not matter so we could say
   <VALUE>
    <QUALIFIER>
     rarely
   </QUALIFER>
      with spines
  </VALUE>

The word "with" should not be in any of this but it is another issue.

Yes, you could do this. It would be slightly more useful to break the text
up into text characters. For example,

#1. <synonymy>/
#2. <comments on habit>/
#3. <comments on leaves>/
#4. <comments on flowers>/
#5. <comments on distribution>/
#6. <general comments and discussion>/

These could still be combined into a single description, but could also be
displayed and searched separately if necessary.

What is usually done is to intersperse such text characters at the
appropriate places in a list of coded characters. They can then be used as
repositories for information that the author can't or doesn't want to code.
The information they contain is accessible in Intkey, and can be used in
much the same way as coded information.

Yes, I agree with all over this. OK, so it was a dumb idea...

Are we agreed then that the basic unit of a description is a statement of
the form

<DESCRIPTION Name = "a taxon or thing">
    <ELEMENT> Name = "a character or feature that the taxon or thing has">
        <VALUE> The value that the element has in this case
            <QUALIFIER> One of a small list of defined qualifiers (e.g.
"rarely") </QUALIFER>
        </VALUE>
        <VALUE>....</VALUE>
    </ELEMENT>
    <ELEMENT>...</ELEMENT>
</DESCRIPTION>

..and that this structure (with suitable properties for elements etc see the
draft spec) can capture any and all parts of a description?

Courple of things:

1. This raises one of the problems of DELTA as pointed out by Gregor and =
others at the TDWG meeting,which is that <comments> are being overloaded =
with meaning. There are various types of things here that are =
masquerading as being similar, when they're not at all.=20

* "<when infected by a virus>" is perhaps a true comment. In the above =
example, could this perhaps be covered by content?

<DESCRIPTION Name =3D "a taxon or thing">
    <ELEMENT> Name =3D "Flower colour">
        <VALUE> red
            <QUALIFIER> rarely </QUALIFER>
        </VALUE>
        when infected by a virus
    </ELEMENT>
</DESCRIPTION>

Note that these comments are only used for natural-language descriptions =
(they're stripped out when DELTA translates to an interactive key etc). =
I don't see why the ordering of these true comments can't be accomodated =
by their position in the content with respect to the tags - since these =
are "trivial" comments in most contexts, this doesn't seem weak to me.

* <occasionally> is a qualifier as defined in the draft spec (only I'm =
calling it "rarely" in line with Lucid's terminology). Lucid is =
currently the only program that uses this type of qualifier in =
identification, and it's very important. But it's not to be confused =
with the common-or-garden variety of comment as above.

* <@reliability 3> is a command for a program. This should be made clear =
by the tag so that other programs can ignore it.

2. &.
I've always been bothered by the use of & (and) vs / (or) in DELTA. =
Using Mike's example:=20

5,3/3&1 =3D "Flowers red, or red and white"

The use of & is handy for codifying natural-language descriptions, but =
in other applications it's highly problematical. This is a homology =
problem and has been discussed at length in the cladistic literature =
e.g.

*CHARACTERS
    #1. Dorsolateral appendages/
        1. arms/
        2. wings/

*ITEMS
#Humans 1,1
#Birds 1,2
#Angels 1,1&2

The discovery of angels (having both arms and wings) would prove the =
non-homology of arms~wings, so the character as stated is false and =
should be restated "Arms present/absent" "Wings present/absent".=20

Similarly, in Mike's example, the red&white broken colouring of =
virus-infected tulips is actually non-homologous with uniform red or =
uniform white and should be a separate character (or at least a separate =
state).

So pending further discussion (which I'm sure will come) I propose that =
the standard should not support the & coding of DELTA.

Over to you, Mike... :-)

|
| Although I think I understand and like what we are trying to do I am
having
| a slight problem here...  a standard that does not enforce itself, is not
| really a standard, is it?

No, I don't think that's what's happening. The question I'm trying to ask
is:

what are the REQUIRED elements of the standard (ie those elements that must
be present for a document to be valid under the standard)?

I'm arguing that there is merit in using a minimal set of required elements,
and of course also incorporating in the standard a larger set of optional
elements. We all do this all the time, e.g. the property PRIVATE NOTES -
no-one would suggest that every document to be valid under the standard
should include private notes, but it's handy having the option to include
these.

It seems to me, for instance, that a CHARACTER LIST element should be
optional, not required. Sure, having a character list allows validation and
a document would be more valuable (in some contexts) for its inclusion, but
I see advantage in not enforcing its presence.

So I'm proposing, as ground-zero, that the only absolute requirements are
that a document have DESCRIPTION elements, that these have ELEMENT elements
(terminology is unfortunate here) and that these have VALUEs. This is a long
way down the track towards minimalism, I know, but I'm floating it for
comment.

So, as I've exampled before, I'd like something like:

<DOCUMENT ID = "d2" Name = "One thing I know about a rose">
    <DESCRIPTION>
        <ITEM>
            <ITEM_NAME> Rose </ITEM NAME>
        </ITEM>
        <ELEMENT>
            <ELEMENT_NAME> Smell </ELEMENT_NAME>
        </ELEMENT>
        <VALUE> Sweet </VALUE>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

to be a valid document. It contains information in a structured way that
means something, and the information can be parsed. Sure, this document
couldn't be used direct as input to Lucid or DELTA, but does that make it
worthless? I'm working at the moment towards a future generation of the
Lucid Builder (and perhaps future DELTA Builders will be similar) that will
indeed be able to collect and interactively integrate such structured bits
of information.

Maybe wacky, but why not?

Cheers - k

This is also useful for the preparation of written descriptions or associated
text to be displayed with in a key. Observations on a species can greatly
improve species descriptions. Things like 'grows on red loams with a northerly
aspect' or 'Similar to species A but with longer thingies and rounder
whatsits'. These are things which would not normally be coded as part of the
data but are useful to the end user, and it is the needs of the end user which
are ultimately important, and for this reason it is useful. Im not a computer
scientist, I just build keys so perhaps I see this in a different light, and
one thing which concerns me is the amount of double handling (and worse) which
creeps in with coding, preparation of associated text, common links etc. The
standard needs to be able to incorporate all useful entities, including 'hard'
data, comments, images, sounds and other media. At the moment we build a key,
then we add images and other associated things, these things should be
considered part of the data and included from the start. The standard should
then allow the elements which are not included for number crunching to be
formatted and presented to the end user in any desired fashion.

I don't mean to be petty, but didn't we pretty much agree on a different
sort of nesting of elements in this general model?

Anyway, I can see that we will need to be cautious with terminology here.
"Element" (and "Attribute") have specific meanings within XML that could
potentially be confused with the terms as used for descriptive data.
Similarly, "valid" has a specific meaning within XML (basically, that a
document is both well-formed and compliant with a specified DTD or Schema),
that is slightly different from the notion of "validity" you are referring
to here (or is it?). I realize that in this context, none of us has much
difficulty using the appropriate mental "namespace", but if we ever reach
the stage of a formal number, we'll need to be careful of this. (Yes, yes,
I know I'm being terribly pedantic, and I'm sorry. But then I am addressing
taxonomists, after all.)

Such a document is not "worthless", but it is definitely "worth less" than
it could be. Arguably, the chief goal in designing a descriptive data model
is to provide a format or structure which can be readily accessed or
manipulated by computer. We humans can usually cope fairly well with
conventional natural language descriptions, but we can do so because of our
substantial background knowledge of life, the universe, and everything. We
can know from a quick glance at the above what is intended (provided we can
read English!). But today's computers have no concept of "Smell", and has
no awareness that the term "Smell" in this description may be in any way
related to the term "fragrance" is some other description. In short, such a
"loosely" structured description has very little advantage over a
description written in natural language in terms of machine readability,
yet suffers some reduction in its human readability.

If you can actually create software that can make real sense of bits of
information like this, you will have accomplished something that has eluded
AI researchers for the past half century.

Of course it's important to be able to store loosely structured bits of
information, but in general the more rigour we can apply, the better.

This discussion brings to mind a debate between the mid 20th century
American poets Robert Frost and Carl Sandberg. Frost argued that writing
poetry in free verse was like playing tennis without a net. Sandberg
countered that tennis would be a better game if there were no net to get in
the way. As one might guess, I've always been inclined to agree with Frost...

I've done this.  I use it as a check -- If I want/need to reverify the

Bob (Object) Morris might have an alternative solution

My database wants that everything should have a name,
otherwise it texts over and talks in blobs.

Mixed content might also impact some of the validation
and context issues discussed earlier.

 From http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210 ,
 Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0.
 "An element type has mixed content when elements of that type may contain

So, to avoid unnecessary rewriting and

| Such a document is not "worthless", but it is definitely "worth less" than
| it could be. Arguably, the chief goal in designing a descriptive data
model
| is to provide a format or structure which can be readily accessed or
| manipulated by computer. We humans can usually cope fairly well with

a
| "loosely" structured description has very little advantage over a
| description written in natural language in terms of machine readability,
| yet suffers some reduction in its human readability.

I agree that having a DELTA-like degree of structure is a worthy goal, and
I'm not excluding such a degree of structure from the proposed standard,
just not requiring it as I keep saying. What I don't agree is that it's such
an obvious gold standard that we should say "for a description to be
regarded as a useful description, it MUST have this degree of structure".

I suppose I keep coming back to this: DELTA has just the degree of structure
you wish for, it's been around for what, 30 years?, it's even been given the
imprimatur as the "World Standard" already and - without putting too fine a
point on it and calling a spade a bloody shovel - it hasn't worked as a
standard. Now I suppose I'm going to get howls of protest over this,
particularly from people who have been using DELTA for years, but I assay
that it's true. The only reason that this discussion is taking place at all
is that TDWG has realised for some time that DELTA as a standard hasn't
worked well, and we need to be open about this.

One solution is to do the fixes to DELTA that have been proposed already
(and have been in draft now for ten years or so) and XMLify it. But it seems
to me that the main limitation of DELTA isn't simply that it isn't XML, or
that it's not complex enough (heaven forbid), or some easily-fixable thing
like that. It's more fundamental, and I suppose I'm exploring some sort of
fundament at the moment. I think part of the basic problem is that it's
tried to force too much structure and while this is a great promise it's
been an impediment in practice. I may well be wrong about this, but I think
there's something in it.

I appreciate the irony, but I think that creating software that can handle
the degree of structure I'm proposing (which is actually considerable, when
you think about it) is a lot different from creating an AI that can precis

The things are similar in that they qualify state values or attributes. The
distinction between free-text and coded qualifiers is also made in the
proposed DELTA enhancements (see
http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/standard/proposal.exe). The coded
qualifiers in the DELTA proposals are distinguished by being preceded by the
symbol '@'. The above example could have been written
    5,3/3&1<when infected with virus>/<@rarely>2<@reliability 3>
The coded qualifiers could be checked for validity by programs, and could be
used by programs for various purposes (including natural-language
descriptions). Although the primary purpose of free-text qualifiers is for
natural-language descriptions, they could also be used for other purposes
(e.g. they could be searched). Their omission from the current version of
Intkey is only for historical reasons (and is also irrelevant to the present
discussion).

Of course, _any_ tag can be ignored or used by a program. I see no reason to
distinguish, in the standard, between those tags that are used by the
current version of LucID, and those that are not. Character and attribute
reliabilities (which are not implemented in the current LucID) are arguably
more important for identification than the '@rarely' qualifier.

'nuff said. The connectors 'and' and 'to' were put in DELTA for this
purpose, in response to user demand. Omitting them from a new standard would
be a retrograde step.

Let's not confuse empirical facts with principles. 'red and white' _could_
be a homologous, intermediate condition between 'red' and 'white', in the
same way that 'red to white' could be (cf. colour change in hydrangeas). You
have tacitly admitted this by suggesting that it could be a separate state.

In multi-purpose databases, you often have to make compromises in the way
characters are defined, so that they will work reasonable well for all
purposes. The possibilities in this example might be

#1. flowers <colour>/
    1. red/
    2. white/

#2. flowers <colour>/
    1. entirely deep red/
    2. red and white/
    3. entirely white/

#3. entirely red flowers <presence>/
    1. present/
    2. absent/

#4. red and white flowers <presence>/
    1. present/
    2. absent/

#5. entirely white flowers <presence>
    1. present/
    2. absent/

Character 1 is simple, produces the best natural-language descriptions, and
is often acceptable for other applications. However, one of the other
formulations would probably have to be used (depending on the capabilities
of the software) if the distinction between 'red and white' and the other
conditions was important for identification or classification. The
natural-language descriptions would suffer, particularly if characters 3-5
were used.

It's impossible to cater for the connector 'to' by redefining characters in
this way.

This is the problem with (or the virtue of) all character-based data systems
(although DELTA does alleviate it by allowing comments and text
'characters', as discussed previously). I agree with Kevin that it is an
impediment to acceptance of such systems. In fact, I think it's the main
impediment - producing comparative data is difficult. Nevertheless,
shouldn't this be one of the main objectives of taxonomy?

Thirty years ago, Leslie Watson wrote:

    Perusal of the average taxonomic-descriptive work usually reveals that
    _as a source of comparative data_ it is hopeless. One genus will be
    described in terms of criteria that receive no mention in the next. Even
    species of the same genus may be described inconsistently. It is often
    impossible to distinguish with any degree of conviction between actual
    observation and extrapolation, between absence of a feature and mere
    failure to seek or comment on it. In general, the further one proceeds
    up the hierarchy, the less comparative the descriptions become. Given
    the situation prevailing in individual publications it is not surprising
    that scanning across them is even less satisfactory. ... If facts are
    wanted for reviewing the classification of a large group it is
    singularly disheartening to have to seek them in miscellaneous works of
    this kind. The labour is immense; worse, one sets out with the
    depressing knowledge that much of it will be wasted on discovering that
    the details thus compiled are not comparative. There is a welter of such
    material theoretically applicable to most major taxonomic problems,
    which will probably never be called upon because of its unpromising
    presentation and sheer intractability.

    L. Watson (1971). Basic taxonomic data: the need for organisation over
    presentation and accumulation. Taxon 20, 131-136.

Things haven't improved much since, and they won't if we back away from
teaching and strongly encouraging people to produce comparative data.
Marking up free text into related chunks and making it available in
electronic form would certainly reduce some of the labour, referred to
above, of the person who is searching for comparative data. But it would not
make non-comparative data comparative, and doing the markup would be a
difficult and probably thankless task.

I think that, in addition to the classificatory problems alluded to above,
the majority of nomenclatural problems (proliferation of synonyms) are the
result of not having readily accessible, comparative data.

> It seems to me that the main limitation of DELTA isn't simply ... that
> it's not complex enough.

I'd say that that's exactly the problem - for 'not complex enough', read
'doesn't have enough features'. Of course, to add new features in the best
way, and to minimize the complexity in some sense, you might have to abandon
existing data structures. However, we should not throw the baby out with the
bathwater. That is, we should retain the useful features of current systems.

Greg,

While validation of mixed content is indeed a problem when using XML 1.0
DTDs, XML Schema can handle it. Quoting from
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/ , XML Schema Part 0: Primer (W3C Working
Draft, 7 April 2000)

"Note that the mixed model in XML Schema differs fundamentally from the mixed
 model in XML 1.0. Under the XML Schema mixed model, the order and number of
 child elements appearing in an instance must agree with the order and number
 of child elements specified in the model. In contrast, under the XML 1.0
 mixed model, the order and number of child elements appearing in an instance
 cannot be constrained. In sum, XML Schema provides full schema validation of
 mixed models in contrast to the partial schema validation provided by XML
 1.0."

While mixed content is best avoided, I'd hate to rule it out completely. In
particular, it might be good if those elements or attributes containing
blobs of text could also contain some embedded HTML (or, rather, XHTML)
markup, to allow for italics, sub- and super-scripts and so on.

This comes back to the question of fitness for purpose...  as part of the
specs we need to define what 'useful' is....  or maybe abstractly, define
how we define 'useful'...

An unstructured blob of text might suit one particular need, but although
containing all the appropriate information, might be totally useless for
others.

It may have if people hadn't gone around ignoring it and inventing
others...  or if it and the suite of products based upon it had been
flexible enough and responsive enough to accommodate what people wanted to
do when they wanted to do it...

My reading of the entrails at the time was the pressure to do the SDD thing
was not that DELTA wasn't working, but rather that there were aggressively
competing alternatives with champions working against each other inventing
different an diverging mousetraps rather than collaborating to build a
better one...  SDD was an attempt to create an environment that would
enable the definition of all descriptive data so it could be exchanged and
shared by all the various application with minimal (zero?) information
loss.  It was to concentrate on data and data structure rather than the
bells an whistles of applications and interfaces.  We seem to be going in
the right direction to do that...

A definition/specification that can accommodate both approaches would be
nice, but it is very unlikely that we will be able to fully resolve the
internal tension between rigour/structure and freedom/flexibility.  They
are incompatible and even if we can formulate a specification to handle
both approaches, at the end of the day people have to apply the specs, and
some will be control freaks, some will be anarchists and others will be
schizophrenic - it is difficult to imagine a real conduit between the extremes.

and sometimes I get the impression the only thing common in the game is the
grass - some are playing tennis on it (with or without a net), others are
playing golf, others croquet, bowls, cricket, soccer, etc.  But it is still
only grass and we should be able to describe the stuff in some universally
comprehensible fashion...

'Structure' apparently means a character list, i.e. the basis for producing
comparative data. Although Kevin says elsewhere that both structured and
unstructured data should be allowed (and I agree - they are allowed in
DELTA), the above statement seems to suggest that the 'impediment' should be
avoided by encouraging the use of non-comparative data.

Given prior comments I think I should rephrase my prior comments about free
text since if is not contradictory to what most others have said since,
although it might not seem that way.

I think that everyone should produce the most standardized, consistent and
meaningful data possible, grounded only on fact and direct observation. If we
had a perfect data model and everyone did that all our problems would be
solved! Problem is that we'll never make a data model that can capture all of
the semantics of the natural world. Even with the expressive power of Natural
Languages we can not do that, certainly no taxonomic data standard will. So
there will always be information that is important to communicate to other
people that will not fit well through the thin pipe of the formal
specifications. When that nasty and unfortunate thing happens, the standard
needs to handle it. We don't want people on real projects avoiding using the
standard because there is some critical piece of information that just will
not
fit through the data model.

Then there is a legacy data... we'll never get enough money to fit it into a
data model to the atomic level. Text blobs will have to do for some of that.

Structure is good when we can get it.

Is this the consensus we are arriving at?  That we strive for structure and
comparability but that we accommodate the free text 'blob' because
oftentimes it may be the best we can get?

Yes?

Great!

Now we can move on to fixing up Brian's dream:

> would be
>solved!

The problem lies not so much with the 'perfect data model', because even
imperfect ones can be made to work, but rather with the 'everyone did that'
thing.   An imperfect data model would work if everyone agreed to use it
within its acknowledged limitations.  After all, we do that sort of stuff
all the time in other database applications.

>Problem is that we'll never make a data model that can capture all of
>the semantics of the natural world.

But I do not think we should bust ourselves trying to do this.  Kevin's
approach of
taking incremental steps in both directions to accommodate plain language
description on one hand, character lists and structure on the other, and a
mixture of both in between, depending on end use and available data,  is
the way to go, and is potentially achievable.

If we accept this, the next step would surely be to revisit Kevin's draft
spec to see if it can do all this, and if it can not, beat it around the
head until it can.

The description blob is an easy thing to model and is not particularly
exciting: <blob>problem solved</blob>, but I accept Kevin's desire to allow
for this in the specs - even this level of structure is better than none at
all. A problem for me is that it is very easy to go from the character list
to the blob without losing anything along the way, but it is next to
impossible to do the reverse.  However, Bryan and others have shown that it
possible to automatically partially deblob or subblob text - this is surely
a step in the right direction that can only improve with technology...

What I would like to see now is a 'real example' of the draft specs applied
to a full 'real taxon' description to see if it really and hold a full
description of a plant (or animal, if you must) in a fully atomized
character list form, a single blob, and something in between...  If the
draft specs can do that, we will be getting somewhere.

<aside relevance=marginal>Speaking with Kevin this evening,  I mentioned an
early impression of the SDD list as being set up to create a standard to
cover descriptive data in a digital environment and at the time the focus
was heavily, if not entirely, on character based systems such as DELTA and
Lucid.   As the list and discussion has matured, we have come to embrace
all forms of biological descriptions so we are now really talking about a
formal specification for all forms of description, and acknowledge that
some people will want to use one part of the spec and others another part
of it.  This seems like a very positive development in the quest for a
universal descriptive data standard, that I do not think we have actually
acknowledged  before.</aside>

I'm feeling a bit as though the whole world's agin' me here, but wotthehell

about where Bryan's coming from also, I think), summed up by:

I am NOT suggesting that comparability of data is not a good idea, and I am
NOT suggesting a retreat to chaos. In fact, it seems to me that what I am
suggesting is more trivial and innocuous than you would imagine from the
responses, and differs from current practice only in being a little better!

The issue to me comes down to two main options: either we create an
exclusive standard that enforces a great deal and leaves most descriptive
data out in the cold, or we create an inclusive one that enforces less but
allows more. It's an interesting issue and a philosphical one, so here goes
with a short ramble on the topic.

In option 1 we would create a standard (S1) similar to the existing Lucid
and DELTA file formats,
just with some enhancements and a more modern (XML?) structure (I suppose
there's also an Option 0 in which we just go with Lucid or DELTA pretty much
as is).
S1 would *require* that a description have a header that includes (for
instance) a character list, a taxon list and some type of item scoring.
Simplest here would be to use coded scoring much like DELTA uses now -
there's little point really in having:

<DOCUMENT>
    <CHARACTER LIST>
        <CHARACTER Character_ID = "1" Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_ID = "1" State_Name = "present"/>
            <STATE State_ID = "2" State_Name = "absent"/>
        </CHARACTER>
    </CHARACTER LIST>
    <TAXON LIST>
        <TAXON Taxon_ID = "1" Taxon_Name = "Viola eminens"/>
    </TAXON LIST>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola eminens">
        <CHARACTER Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

..you'd be better off with..

<DOCUMENT>
    <CHARACTER LIST>
        <CHARACTER Character_ID = "1" Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_ID = "1" State_Name = "present"/>
            <STATE State_ID = "2" State_Name = "absent"/>
        </CHARACTER>
    </CHARACTER LIST>
    <TAXON LIST>
        <TAXON Taxon_ID = "1" Taxon_Name = "Viola eminens"/>
    </TAXON LIST>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_ID = "1">
        <CHARACTER ID = "1"><VALUE ID = "1"></CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

S1 would enforce standardization (e.g. comparability) of descriptions
(within a document), would allow all sorts of validations, would be
moderately rigorous, and would probably be used by about the same number of
people as use Lucid and DELTA today.

In option 2 we would create a standard (S2) similar in almost all respects
to S1,
merely with the difference that it would allow but not enforce a character
list and taxon list etc. Both examples given above would be valid under S2,
but so also would

<DOCUMENT>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola hederacea">
        <CHARACTER Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

As I said, this actually seems to me to be fairly innocuous. But it has
interesting implications.

First, to clear up another misapprehension, under S2 I am NOT suggesting
that
every description should be a separate document, and I would expect that
this would rarely be the case. S2 just doesn't force the issue.

The main objection to S2 seems to be that you could have another document
similar to the one above that would not be fully comparable e.g.

<DOCUMENT>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola banksii">
        <CHARACTER Character_Name = "Foliage">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

This is the true. But does S1 (or current practice) get around this? Not at
all - you could
just as easily have two documents under S1 (or two treatments under Lucid or
DELTA) that are equally incomparable. The only way to really get around the
problem of comparability
is to have a universal lexicon and to force everyone to use the same
characters and states. We've discussed this before, and I think the
consensus was that it's a neat idea, but....

The interesting thing about both S1 and S2 is that neither precludes the
possibility of the development of a lexicon, universal or local. In the
draft standard I proposed that a document COULD have a character/state list,
and that this could be embedded in the document or could be an external
resource. An external character/state list would be a lexicon if several
documents refer to it, and it could even be a universal one if everyone
referred to it. Again, the standard just wouldn't enforce this.

An interesting aside is that DELTA also allows lexica in much the same way.
We could have had such a successful CHARS file developed 30 years ago that
everyone's used the same file ever since. It just hasn't happened.

The critical difference between S1 and S2 is in the degree of allowance for
variation in practice. S1, following the Lucid and DELTA model, would allow
one data structure
only to be regarded as valid under the standard - it would enforce
comparability in structure (although not in content as discussed above). All
other descriptions
would be deemed not sufficiently rigorous and discounted until their authors
have done the extra work to format them accordingly which, as Bryan points
out for legacy data, will probably never happen. S2, on the other hand,
would be looser in the sense that less highly structured documents would be
allowed. Note here that these documents would be less structured, not
unstructured.

How does this compare with what we have now? Currently, a few descriptions
on the web are highly structured DELTA documents, and the vast majority are
completely unstructured blobs from which little or nothing can be recovered
except perhaps that they include one or more words somewhere within them.
That is, the vast majority of descriptions are left out in the cold. Now Les
Watson's sentiments expressing his frustrations about these documents 30
years ago are relevant and noble, and in the best of all possible worlds all
descriptions today or tomorrow would be fully structured in the way the Les
suggested. S2 doesn't change any of this, but it does provide a
stepping-stone from unstructured to structured. S1 also doesn't change any
of this, it merely provides no stepping stone - it goes for broke. It seems
to me that without the stepping stone, most descriptions will stay in the
cold.

Jim Croft has assayed that what I'm suggesting is impossible:

| A definition/specification that can accommodate both approaches would be
| nice, but it is very unlikely that we will be able to fully resolve the
| internal tension between rigour/structure and freedom/flexibility.  They
| are incompatible and even if we can formulate a specification to handle
| both approaches, at the end of the day people have to apply the specs, and
| some will be control freaks, some will be anarchists and others will be
| schizophrenic - it is difficult to imagine a real conduit between the
extremes.

But it seems to me that the difference between S1 and S2 in some ways is
trivial - both would include the same elements and properties, but S1 would
make more of these required while in S2 a minimal set would be required and
more would be optional. Is this a return to the chaos of the past?

Here are some examples.

Let's say that out there in webland there is a document

<DOCUMENT>
Viola eminens K. Thiele & Prober, sp. nov.
Perennial herb spreading by stolons; rootstock sometimes somewhat swollen
and bulbous at the stem bases. Stems contracted so that the leaves form
rosettes, never elongate with caulescent leaves. Leaves broad-reniform, the
largest (10-)12-15(-25) mm long, (20-)25-35(-45) mm wide, 1.5-3.2 times
wider than long, usually with a broad basal sinus; lamina with 9-20 +/-
prominent teeth, glabrous or with scattered unicellular hairs on the upper
surface, +/- concolorous bright green; petioles 2-8 cm long; stipules
narrowly triangular, usually with several small, glandular teeth on each
side. Flowers ... etc
</DOCUMENT>

Currently, the best we could tell of this document is that it contains
various words, amongst which are "Viola", "eminens" etc. If we were
searching the web for descriptive data for V. eminens, we would perhaps hit
upon this document, but we couldn't distinguish it from this one:

<DOCUMENT>
Hi Mum,
the garden's really growing well this spring, and that Viola eminens you
sent me is flowering beautifully
much love, Kevin
</DOCUMENT>

Let's say that the descriptive data standard S2 has in it only one absolute
requirement, which is that a description must be tagged and named. Our first
document becomes:

<DOCUMENT>
<DESCRIPTION Name = "Viola eminens">
Viola eminens K. Thiele & Prober, sp. nov.
Perennial herb spreading by stolons; rootstock sometimes somewhat swollen
and bulbous at the stem bases. Stems contracted so that the leaves form
rosettes, never elongate with caulescent leaves. Leaves broad-reniform, the
largest (10-)12-15(-25) mm long, (20-)25-35(-45) mm wide, 1.5-3.2 times
wider than long, usually with a broad basal sinus; lamina with 9-20 +/-
prominent teeth, glabrous or with scattered unicellular hairs on the upper
surface, +/- concolorous bright green; petioles 2-8 cm long; stipules
narrowly triangular, usually with several small, glandular teeth on each
side. Flowers ... etc
</DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

This simple thing is already a huge advance, because we can now sift out
this decription from amongst all other documents containing the key words.
Sure the stuff between <DESCRIPTION> and </DESCRIPTION> is blob text and a
computer can't do much with it. But we've still got somewhere.

Now the important thing about S2 is that it doesn't leave it there. It says,
in effect, "OK, if you want to provide more structure for these data, follow
these rules..." Our document could now become something like:

<DOCUMENT>
<DESCRIPTION Name = "Viola eminens">
Viola eminens K. Thiele & Prober, sp. nov.
<ELEMENT Name = "Longevity"><VALUE>Perennial </VALUE></ELEMENT> <ELEMENT
Name = "Habit"><VALUE>herb</VALUE> spreading by stolons; rootstock sometimes
somewhat swollen and bulbous at the stem bases. Stems contracted so that the
leaves form rosettes, never elongate with caulescent leaves. Leaves
broad-reniform, the largest (10-)12-15(-25) mm long, (20-)25-35(-45) mm
wide, 1.5-3.2 times wider than long, usually with a broad basal sinus;
lamina with 9-20 +/- prominent teeth, glabrous or with scattered unicellular
hairs on the upper surface, +/- concolorous bright green; petioles 2-8 cm
long; stipules narrowly triangular, usually with several small, glandular
teeth on each side. Flowers ... etc
</DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

Another huge advance, because now we can parse the document and extract bits
of descriptive data (note also the entertaining thing that we could also
ignore the tags and render our document as the original natural language).

But our document still hasn't reached the gold standard. So, S2 says "So
much for straight markup, if you now want to make the document more
standardised, follow these rules to include a character list...". And you
could do just that. Or, you could include a reference to an external
character list (a lexicon) and do the work to force your document through
Bryan's narrow pipe. At somewhere around this stage the document becomes
valid input for, say, Lucid or IntKey. Or, you could start from scratch and
create a document just like current Lucid and DELTA documents. Then S2 would
say "OK, you have a structured document, but what about annotations as to
where the bits of data came from - to include those, follow these rules..."
or "if your name's Peter Stevens and you want to link this document to
another that stores information for specimens and describe some rules for
converting leaf measurements to standardised shapes, follow these rules..."
and now S2 is way beyond current best practice. So much for it being weak!

Consider now S1. It says "Sorry mate, your description's bloody useless,
it's just not up to scratch, go away and don't come back until you've
completely broken it up into bits, with character and taxon lists, and then
we'll talk turkey"

This is what I mean by S1 leaving most descriptions out in the cold. S2
provides incremental steps for improving the structure of documents. S1 goes
for broke the first time. Does this make S2 weak, or somehow threaten the
basis of systematics? Under S2, if you're a Lucid freak or DELTAHead you can
create, publish and exchange your Lucid or DELTA documents just as you do
now. But if you're not (and most taxonomists aren't) it provides a way of
improving the structure of your data by following a standardised set of
rules. So Jim, it's not a standard that isn't a standard.

So tell me, does *anyone* out there agree with me?

Cheers - k

Well, I don't thing we're really all that far apart. As Jim Croft nicely
summarized it:

"Is this the consensus we are arriving at?  That we strive for structure and
comparability but that we accommodate the free text 'blob' because
oftentimes it may be the best we can get? Yes? Great!"

So I'm largely in agreement with you, Kevin, with the disagreement perhaps
being on where we should aim as our primary target on the
structure/unstructred spectrum. (That is, I'd prefer to see highly
structure information as the "default", with loosely structured "blobs"
being optional, rather than the other way round.)

A similar sort of problem must occur commonly with specimen databases. For
example, how to you capture a "location"? You might prefer to have lats,
longs, and elevations nicely geocoded to the nearest meter, but the label
on a older specimen might not say much more than "in a shady little
billabong along Reedy Creek, back of Beyond". It's desirable to be able to
store that information one way or another, even when it doesn't fit into
your preferred structure, but used structured data when you can get it.

As a programmer, I'd like to be able to know whether I'm looking at a
rigourously defined object or something "fuzzier". I think one could fairly
easily accomodate both. Modifying one of Kevin's examples only slightly,
you could have something like:

<DOCUMENT>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola odorata">
        <CHARACTER type="defined" Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
        <CHARACTER type="arbitrary" Character_Name = "scent">
           a marvelous perfume on a perfect spring day
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

where there is some small distinction made between rigourously defined
characters (those which can be validated against some "character list",
sensu lato, and for which cross-taxa comparisons are clearly meaningful),
and characters defined "on the fly". (Note: I'm not so sure that using
attributes is syntactically the best way to do this, but it illustrates the
principle.)

Of course, as Mike would point out, such characters are really not terribly
different from DELTA "text" characters...

I suspect that how all this eventually gets used will depend substantially
on the sorts of editing and markup tools that are developed. I don't really
anticipate that many taxonomists will want to go through their existing
natural language descriptions and insert <ELEMENT></ELEMENT> tags manually.
It's not only tedious, it's too darned easy to make mistakes. And perhaps
the editing tools can be made clever enough that maintaining a character
list isn't all that difficult. But it's still a good idea to have a system
flexible enough to catch material that doesn't fit the mold.

So we do agree, kind of...

I would like to make two points.  Kevin referred to having 'leaves' used
in one document and 'foliage' in a separate, distinct document.  What I
dread is seeing the following in a single document:

<DOCUMENT>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola hederacea">
        <CHARACTER Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola banksii">
        <CHARACTER Character_Name = "Foliage">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

Are the characters "leaves" and "foliage" comparable in this document?
Probably they are, but the only way to be 100% certain is to examine
specimens of Viola hederacea and Viola banksii.  This will put me back
into the same situation that I have been struggling with all of my
professional career: attempting to match the variable, and sometimes wild
terminology, occurring in descriptions.

The second point is that humans, as a species, have a strong tendency to
"take the easiest path".  Unless a significant reward is provided or they
are forced to use a certain technique, they will invariably do the
easiest, simplest thing.  If they can just throw in hunks of description,
as the default, that is what they will do.  I support Eric's idea that
character and taxon lists should be the default standard, and something
extra has to be done to throw in hunks of description.  Perhaps this will

I am not sure how you could come up with a standard that would prevent this
sort of headache...  Both delta and lucid editors allow you to build and
encode the above with no problem at all, not even a warning message...  It
is the knowledge, skill and intellect of the compiler that keeps it out...

Where a standard could have an impact is in the area of trying to combine
data from different compilers with different knowledge, skill and
intellect... If we have a standard description/character/state
specification it might be possible to map the
leaves/foliage/flat_green_things of different compilers to each other...

This is the end of the spectrum I am coming from.  A standard or
specification that allows, encourages, or even enforces, internal
consistency within a document is only slightly interesting, and delta or
lucid can do that already.  But something that can bring together and give
useful access to descriptive data from different sources and different
times - that is exciting...

This is the direction I would like the specs go as well...  accommodate and

We had a real example of this sort to thing here the other day.  Someone
wanted a list of tree species from New Guinea, so we attacked our specimen
database with a query for records with New Guinea or Iran Jaya in the
locality field and tree in the habit and notes fields - this seemed like a
logical thing to do at the time.  The result was absolutely disastrous
because to lack of rigour in these free text fields.  There were herbs,
shrubs and vines all through the list because they were  recorded as
growing in, on, under or around trees.  But on the surface, it seemed  like
a fairly reasonable and straightforward query to make.

This has to be a given doesn't it?  No-one is going to want hand score this
data long-hand and will be expecting to use point and click tools like the
delta and lucid editors that save typing, maintain consistency, etc.  What
we are talking about here is the type of data that is scored and stored,
and how it is transferred between applications, not what the various
application might decide to do with it.  Right?

Yes, I think that this should be the primary focus as well -- both as a
programmer and a botanist.

And this is something which I am currently *painfully* aware of.  I'm a
member of the ATBI plants group (the Biodiversity Inventory of the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park ...  qv. www.discoverlife.org or
www.goldsword.com/sfarmer/ATBI for our taxon pages ... they're supposed
to get crosslinked *eventually* ... ) and one of the things that we're
doing at the moment is databasing all of our legacy data -- all the
herbarium sheets that we have.

Unfortunately, for starters, that location
data is all going into a big blob *initially* so that it can be analysed
and determined what fields we have and which ones that we really want
to use -- we're also working with the folks who are designing the Final
Database that we're going to use because we have the most legacy data
already in databases.

And this might be something to consider --
your legacy label says something like "adjacent to Reedy Creek." and
that's all.  So, you go back later, and *can* add additional information
because that population is still there -- perhaps it's the only one
along the creek -- how do you add that information into the existing
record and identify it as *added* data?  It's valid -- some of it
more-so than others, perhaps.  Maybe all you might be able to add is
the County -- or a gross locality name -- "Greenbrier Section" but
you want to identify it as added data.  Would that be something that
this group would want to consider?  I know that it goes back to
the Validation issues ...

This preference has been endorsed by several people, and seems to come down
to whether a character list is required or optional.

In my draft model, a character list is optional (but obviously pretty
necessary if anyone wants to parse the description). If a character list is
present it can be used for validation, if one is absent no validation can
occur. Similarly, if a part of a description is tagged as a defined
character, it's useable as such, if another part is not so tagged, it's not.

Eric offered:

<DOCUMENT>
    <DESCRIPTION Taxon_Name = "Viola odorata">
        <CHARACTER type="defined" Character_Name = "Leaves">
            <STATE State_Name = "present">
        </CHARACTER>
        <CHARACTER type="arbitrary" Character_Name = "scent">
           a marvelous perfume on a perfect spring day
        </CHARACTER>
    </DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

But this still requires atomisation of the description (the character
"scent" has been atomised out of the description 'ground matrix'). Since
we're agreed that an 'arbitrary' character is not usefully parseable, what's
the point of atomising it?

How would this model accommodate my example:

<DOCUMENT>
<DESCRIPTION Name = "Viola eminens">
Perennial herb spreading by stolons; rootstock sometimes somewhat swollen
and bulbous at the stem bases. Stems contracted so that the leaves form
rosettes, never elongate with caulescent leaves. Leaves broad-reniform, the
largest (10-)12-15(-25) mm long, (20-)25-35(-45) mm wide, 1.5-3.2 times
wider than long, usually with a broad basal sinus; lamina with 9-20 +/-
prominent teeth, glabrous or with scattered unicellular hairs on the upper
surface, +/- concolorous bright green; petioles 2-8 cm long; stipules
narrowly triangular, usually with several small, glandular teeth on each
side. Flowers ... etc
</DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

if Thiele and Prober are not yet up to the stage of atomising the
description. Under Eric's model, it seems to me that this would need to be:

<DOCUMENT>
    <CHARACTER LIST>
        <CHARACTER Name = "Free text" Type = "arbitrary"/>
    </CHARACTER LIST>
<DESCRIPTION Name = "Viola eminens">
<CHARACTER Character_Name = "Free text">
Perennial herb spreading by stolons; rootstock sometimes somewhat swollen
and bulbous at the stem bases. Stems contracted so that the leaves form
rosettes, never elongate with caulescent leaves. Leaves broad-reniform, the
largest (10-)12-15(-25) mm long, (20-)25-35(-45) mm wide, 1.5-3.2 times
wider than long, usually with a broad basal sinus; lamina with 9-20 +/-
prominent teeth, glabrous or with scattered unicellular hairs on the upper
surface, +/- concolorous bright green; petioles 2-8 cm long; stipules
narrowly triangular, usually with several small, glandular teeth on each
side. Flowers ... etc
</CHARACTER>
</DESCRIPTION>
</DOCUMENT>

This seems like essentially tagging the blob as tagless.

In terms of a data model, tagging data adds information to it, so surely the
untagged state is more basic (fundamental) than the tagged. The question of
whether our
default behaviour should be to tag data is to me a sociological one, and
should be handled outside the data model.

Subject:      digital camera horizon

Eastman Kodak and a young company named Foveon have each announced
image acquisition chips and prototype digital cameras with resolution
of 4096x4096 on a 22mm x 22mm chip, i.e. about 16 million pixels per
square inch at the imaging surface. This is approximately the
resolution of conventional photographic film. (A brief informative
article comparing film resolution to digital image resolution is at
http://www.luminous-landscape.com/pixels_vs_film.htm)

Foveon's founder is Carver Mead, who is more or less the inventor of
chips for image acquisition.

Foveon's home page is http://www.foveon.net/

Kodak's 4k x 4k sensor is described at
http://www.kodak.com/country/US/en/digital/ccd/kaf16800.shtml
it's on a slightly bigger surface and is likely more expensive to
produce (different technology) than Foveon's.

Both devices are monochrome, so it might be another year before we see
color of this resolution, but both companies behave, and speak, as
though they do not expect silver halide technology to be
around much longer for capturing images.

[This is bcc'd to several mailing lists. Apologies for duplicates you
may receive.]

The Taxonomic Working Group subgroup on the Structure of Descriptive
Data (TDWG-SDD) of the International Union of Biological Sciences
maintains an email discussion list on which there has been recent
discussion of proposals of Kevin Thiele to formulate XML
representations of a minimal controlled vocabulary for taxonomic
descriptive data. The material at
http://www.cs.umb.edu/efg/ThieleDraft/thiele_0_3.html illustrates our
efforts to draft an XML Schema from Thiele's draft proposal version
0.3 ("TDD0.3") and illustrate its utility with simple
applications manipulating a taxonomic treatment.

Some of the pieces are best viewed with MSIE5, but any browser should
do.

We'll be talking about this work at the TDWG meeting in Frankfurt
November 10-12.

Bob's put a draft SDD proposal up for comment. Note that this is a skeleton
only - we're trying to work out at the moment how to capture the base
elements. Other issues discussed in earlier SDD drafts and through this
list - such as data attribution, collation, inheritance etc - will be
incorporated if this stuff seems to work so far.

No-one seems to be commenting on this, at least on the list... is it all
too scary?  With Halloween just around the corner, do these guys deserve to
be tricked or treated?

Unless people are commenting directly to Kevin/Bob/Jun, I would imagine
they would be feeling pretty disappointed so far...

I have been through this a number of times, still trying to come to grips
with the various options that have been used from the draft specs of a few
weeks ago... and why...

This is a great attempt at implementation and surely demonstrates that we
are on the right track...  doesn't it?

Yes, the format does seem a bit verbose, but from what I gather Bob and Jun
are saying, let the software, applications and databases worry about that...

Personally I prefer something like:

<taxonomy>
     <rank="species" value="alfari"/>
     <rank="genus" value="Azteca"/>
     <author value="Emery"/>
     <year value="1893"/>
</taxonomy>

to something like:

<DESCRIPTION name="Taxonomic Information">
    <FEATURE name="Species Name">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>alfari</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
    <FEATURE name="Genus Name">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>Azteca</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
    <FEATURE name="Namer">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>Emery</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
    <FEATURE name="Name Year">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>1893</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
</DESCRIPTION>

but if we never have to read it in this format, I do not suppose it really
matters...

Anyway, it looks as though we are settling on an architecture allows both
discursive descriptions accommodated by 'narrative' elements, and for the
compulsive obsessives, a nested set of 'features' that can have
'feature_values', 'qualifers' and associated 'narrative'...  Right?

And that the competing architecture of a list of 'feature_values' that can
be present, absent, unknown, doubtful, present by misinterpretation, absent
by misinterpretation, imaginary, etc. has been given the flick?

Or having coded the data in this manner, is this distinction in data
representation employed by different interactive identification products,
not really relevant or meaningful?

Sorry about the rambling - just trying to come to grips with what has been
done here...  I am pretty sure it is good stuff once I work out what it all
means...

One vague background concern I have is with things like:

<FEATURE name="Page Author">
    <FEATURE name="name">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>John T. Longino</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
    <FEATURE name="efg address">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>The Evergreen State College, Olympia WA 98505
USA</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
    <FEATURE name="email">
       <FEATURE_VALUE>longinoj@elwha.evergreen.edu</FEATURE_VALUE>
    </FEATURE>
</FEATURE>

which seems on the surface to correspond to ye olde library cataloguing
metadata stuff.  Is there a wheel here we do not need to reinvent?

Related to this there are a number of projects around to place using XML to
mark up and display descriptive data and taxonomic treatments and they seem
to inventing rafts of 'feature' names for what appear to be the same things
in terms of blocks onf information.  At the higher and metadata level, is
it too early to talk about rationalizing these?  Being very wary here, not
wanting to open the Pandora's character-list box of worms again...

Not really. We believe that it is pretty straightforward to translate
between this kind of format and the one more spiritually akin to XML
and will illustrate that Real Soon Now. The biggest thing we need to
think about is exactly how the XML id reference mechanisms should be
used to implement things as in Kevin's examples.

My own view is that there should actually be a single standard
representation with a bunch of ways to transform between it and other
desired representations. The advantage of this is that you need fewer
translators to go between representations A and B if everything has a
bidirectional representation with a common one, X. The disadvantage is
that you change X at the risk of breaking X<->A, thereby breaking
A<->B when neither A nor B changed. That said, I think that this issue
should not have lots of philosophical discussion until we, or somebody
else, demonstrates the conversion between list-like formats and
tree-like formats.

Absolutely. Per our remarks in the web page, we mainly did this out of
time constraints. For metadata, there is no doubt that the Dublin Core
and its extension the Darwin Core should be looked at. For
bibliographic things, the American Publishers Association has an SGML
DTD which is likely to be XML by now, etc. I'll write some references
to those for people to consider.

Well, I certainly hope that responses aren't limited to those of us having
mailboxes at pi.csiro.au (that is, Kevin, Jim, and myself).

I applaud the effort Bob Morris and Jun Wan have gone to it constructing
this example. They have provided a good demonstration of the power of XML
and XSLT to hold information and rapidly render it in a variety of forms. I
suspect most of us find that a concrete working example of this sort is a
lot easier to evaluate than is a relatively abstract discussion of standards.

It may well be the right track (depending on the desired destination), but
there's still a lot of ground to cover before arriving at the final stop...

One thing that might be helpful would be for this group to come up with a
short set of basic design goals that indicate what our objectives really
are. My understanding is that the developers of XML itself found such a set
of goals to be very useful. Their list of goals was (and still is) to quote
from the W3C Recommendation for XML 1.0:

"The design goals for XML are:
XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.
XML shall support a wide variety of applications.
XML shall be compatible with SGML.
It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.
The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute
minimum, ideally zero.
XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear.
The XML design should be prepared quickly.
The design of XML shall be formal and concise.
XML documents shall be easy to create.
Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance."
Can we develop a similar set of goals and principles (perhaps even using
some of the XML principles as a basis)?

One other point - Bob Morris said:

The goal of a single standard representation readily translatable into
other representations was, of course, the original goal of DELTA, and its
advantages are clear. But perhaps the biggest challenge with any such
standard is that it needs to be very comprehensive and flexible - ideally,
it should be able to store everything that all of the "subsidiary" formats
is capable of representing, and do so in such a way that X<->Y translations
are as lossless as possible.

There is no mention of character lists in this draft (perhaps it is to come
in later versions). There is currently no way of ensuring that descriptions
are comparative.

There are two things mixed in here, surely.

1. Yes, I think an architecture that allows both discursive (read "natural
language" if you will) and coded (DELTA-like) descriptions is feasible. The
principal difference between discursive and coded forms is that one uses
idrefs and the other doesn't - so as Bob notes, once the XMLHeads work out
how to use idrefs here we will hopefully be able to accommodate the coded
form.

2. In either case, there is still a need for a limited set of qualifiers for
feature values (ie present, uncertain, present by misinterpretation etc).
This will surely simply be another layer of complexity that will be added to
the core once it's robust.

This is partially implemented already (using two rather curious qualifiers):
- <FEATURE name="color">
  <FEATURE_VALUE QUALIFIER="highly">varies between colonies</FEATURE_VALUE>
  <FEATURE_VALUE QUALIFIER="maybe">concolorous yellow-brown</FEATURE_VALUE>
  <FEATURE_VALUE>bicolored with darker head</FEATURE_VALUE>
  <FEATURE_VALUE>concolorous brown</FEATURE_VALUE>
  </FEATURE>

Presumably, Bob's comments:
>As we represent it, TDD0.3 has only a few classes of objects:
>FEATURE a complex type with a name attribute and containing a string-based
FEATURE_VALUE,
>NARRATIVEs and, recursively, other FEATUREs.
>DESCRIPTION a container of FEATUREs and NARRATIVES.
>NARRATIVE a string-based type suitable for extension to more complex
markup.

>Our goal was the production and application of a Schema for TDD0.3, and

means that many things will eventually be moved out of the rather
featureless FEATURE and DESCRIPTION objects into more purpose-built
structures.

How's this for a start?

SDD shall allow any description of an object, item or taxon to be marked up
for its data content
SDD shall comprise a single standard, but be flexible enough to allow a wide
variety of transformations
SDD shall allow capture of all standard data elements currently allowed by
Lucid, DELTA [...add to this list...] etc.
SDD shall allow but not require rich attribution of all data elements
SDD shall allow hierarchical structuring of documents and collation of data
from one document into another
SDD shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.
SDD documents shall be straightforward to parse
SDD markup shall be performable by hand
The design of SDD shall be formal and concise.
Terseness in SDD markup is of minimal importance.

One that I don't fully understand from the XML list is:
| The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute
| minimum, ideally zero.

How does this apply to us? The flexibility we need is such that options are
essential - just as in Lucid, DELTA etc where character sets, dependencies,
subsidiary files etc are all optional. In fact, I've argued that
non-optional (required) data elements should be kept to a minimum - and
sdd0.3 is based on this working principle, hence the non-requiredness of
e.g. character lists.

See goals 2&3 above.

Our intention exactly. But not *too much* later, given how important
interoperability with the large amount of list based data there is.
In fact, it will be the next thing we work on. I don't think that a
start (including translations back and forth from lists to trees) will
be very difficult. I do suspect that discussion of details will end up
being extensive. At W3C this kind of thing often goes through 7-8
rounds of comment and revision before a recommendation appears. People
may wish to see Sec 6.2 of the W3C Process Document to see how they
proceed to bring something through to the status of
Recommendation. (They leave "Standard" to standards bodies).

This is encouraging...

The important thing for the SDD group to focus on is how the character list
will be specified by SDD, not on the character lists themselves...  I
really do not want to go there again...

I think Bob's suggestion the we consider ourselves to be working towards a
big R Recommendation rather than a 'Standard' is a healthy and non
threatening way of bringing more people on board in this exercise.

Can someone remind me... what does SDD stand for?

Well, only part of this intersects the distinction that we are working
against, though the non-intersection is certainly important one. The
distinction we are presently thinking about is purely syntactic. It is
whether the XML data representation is tree structured (by a
non-linear tree) and without idref's or is linearly structured and with
idrefs. In fact all trees can be flattened into lists if by nothing
else than adding references to the mix. It's easy to be convinced of
this: trees can be represented in the conventional linear memory
supplied with most computers, so it is clearly possible (and not that
hard). What we want to get right is not whether this can be
done---since we know it can---but specifically whether XML's reference
mechanisms will capture the requirements of the intended stakeholders
in the enterprise. We hope it does, because there is a BIG advantage
to using XML: there is an abundance of tools, protocols, databses and
services available to those who adopt it.

The question of discursive in the sense of natural langauge doesn't
directly enter our present efforts, though we've been thinking a
little about it. Gregor Hegedorn has implemented an approach in which
his database is the source of the natural language syntax in that it
stores verbs that a given description can access to produce something
that produces---at worst---bemused smiles from a human reader. This
may be a reasonable for discursive representations in XML too but we
didn't attempt to capture it. Rather we forced some of our sample into
our model by changing the English grammar a little. For example, we
text whose original was part of a diaganosis whose discourse
was

Workers: scapes and tibiae lack erect hair

we marked as

<FEATURE name="scapes and tibiae erect hair">
  <FEATURE_VALUE>lack</FEATURE_VALUE>
</FEATURE>

Naive discursive rendering of this would probably emerge as

scapes and tibiae erect hair lack.

Of course, Gregor might be happy about that sentence order. :-)

For me, what is lurking under the covers here is this: I don't think
that high quality human readability of the naked markup is that
important. I think it is the job of application software to render
markup palatable to humans if that is the problem, or to other
software if that is the problem.

We extracted "highly" and "maybe" from the original.  This raises an
interesting point. It may well be good to recommend a specific set of
qualifiers. That allows more intelligent applications. For example,
(and neglecting that "highly variable" and "frequently variable" are
probably not acceptable as nearly equivalent ) it might be easier to
guide identification software if "frequently" is uniformly used where
appropriate, thus perhaps identifying some initially more (or less)
important feature. However, (a).An author might not be completely
satisfied with that qualifier and (b) an author may be satisfied but
prefer something else in natural language discourse. Probably this
entails recommending a mechanism for specifying alternatives to the
'official' qualifier. Those mechanisms could guide applications that
were aware of them. For example

<FEATURE_VALUE QUALIFIER="frequently" RENDER_QUALIFIER_AS="highly">

But this would seem to be to be a pretty important distinction and
something that would have to be decided one way or the other in the
Recommendation that we are going to come up with. Or are we thinking of a
Recommendation that would allow both?  It would be nice to be able to say,
here is the one true path, wouldn't it?

Bob can you post an example of what a tree stucture represented linearly
with idrefs _might_ look like?

At the end of the day we unfortunately have to deal with humans, and
taxonomic humans which are even worse, so readability of final output is
going to be a *major* issue.  The data will need to be in a form that
appropriate tools can transmute into something as close to natural language
as possible.  Otherwise the punters will walk away...

I was thinking the exact same thoughts and even started preparing a list of
suggested qualifiers but quickly gave up because the list would end as
infinite as individual human vaguery and indecision and preferences for
particular turns of phrase.  It started to look too much like the trying to
standardize character lists exercise.

Lucid appeared to offer one - the by misinterpretation thing.  Delta
appeared to offered infinite - through the comment thing.   Or are these
conceptually different attributes?  Perhaps it might be possible to come up
with a manageable list of qualifiers?  Qualifiers In Current Use?

To have any useful application you would have to come up with a limited
list of recommended qualifiers, and a mountain of possible synonyms, or
almost synonyms, beneath them.  All too scary for me...

Why would you want to say this sort of thing in the XML dataset rather than
the XML aware application?  If your preferred qualifier is 'highly' rather
than 'frequently', why wouldn't you just code the data that way in the
first place?  Surely the most appropriate place for these sort of
translations is in the application that is designed to render data in a
particular way for a particular purpose (as it the wont of those fascist
editor types and other control freaks)?

I guess you might want to tell an application this if the only choice of
qualifiers you have is this, in this instance, use this particular
one.   Sort of like converse of how style sheets can specify a font, but
give the application a choice of what to use if that font can not be found.

Nope...  still too scary...

Bob and Jim,

surely the problem is that the "information" in a natural-language
description and the "data" needed for e.g. an interactive key are not
completely, and never will be completely, mappable. To try to make them
fully mappable involves forcing a massively parallel supercomputer (the one
sitting in front of the screen) to be content with the data potentials of an
electronic calculator.

| Workers: scapes and tibiae lack erect hair
|
| mapped as
|
| <FEATURE name="scapes and tibiae erect hair">
|   <FEATURE_VALUE>lack</FEATURE_VALUE>
| </FEATURE>
|
| reverse-mapped to:
|
| scapes and tibiae erect hair lack.

makes me cringe. And this after all the shit heaped on taxonomists! :-)

We gotta do a whole lot better than this. I'm sure we will.

We have a better grasp now of the id mechanisms and are thinking along
lines described briefly below. If any XMLers will be in Frankfurt, I'd
like to talk more about these lines.

I. A general question for comment

We think that Kevin's example 9 the <DESCRIPTION> is really meant to be

<DESCRIPTION ID = "1">
<FEATURE IDREF="1"> <VALUE IDREF="3">
<FEATURE IDREF="2"> <VALUE IDREF="1">
</DESCRIPTION>

rather than

<DESCRIPTION ID = "1">
<FEATURE ID="1"> <VALUE ID="3">
<FEATURE ID="2"> <VALUE ID="1">
</DESCRIPTION>

as written. That is, the features and values are *references* to
features given ID's in earlier elements. Thus in this case
such a description is equivalent to

<DESCRIPTION ID = "1">
  <FEATURE NAME="Habit">
     <FEATURE_VALUE>Herb</FEATURE_VALUE>
  </FEATURE>
  <FEATURE NAME="Stolons">
     <FEATURE_VALUE>Present</FEATURE_VALUE>
  </FEATURE>
</DESCRIPTION>


II. Global feature values (This may be a Delta question).

In 0.3's Examples 8 and 9 there do not seem to be any global feature
values. Instead, all possible values are completely local to
features. For example, can there be a list of feature values
containing both "present" and "absent" to which any feature can refer,
whether or not those values are in that feature's local list of
values? Or rather, must every feature that wishes to allow those
values name them in its list of possible values>

III. Unique ID's (Non XML hackers please avert your eyes).  We can not
see where XML-Schema Schema syntactically enforces uniqueness of
ID's. If this is so, ID uniqueness must either be ignored, enforced by
context, or enforced by semantics at processing time. For example, in
draft 0.3, several objects have id="1". The XPath function library is
strong enough to use an ID as key when its uniqueness is given only by
context as in Examples 8 and 9 in draft 0.3, but if we accept this
approach, will we end up with a Schema against which validity testing
is hard? OTOH, if we are wrong and XML-Schema Schema does enforce
global uniqueness of ID, then must we uniqify the proposal by encoding
the context in the ID itself? That seems fragile.

Ah, Jun Wan reminds me that uniqueness of ID attribute values is
imposed by XML itself. So in the Delta-like descriptions, the choices
I see are to generate unique ID's that encode the context or to use a
different attribute than ID, perhaps something like TDWGID. In the
former case one might have something like:
        ID="F.1" to mean that this is an id for feature 1
        ID="F.V.1.2" to mean that this is value 2 for feature 1
In XSLT, these are parseable with the XPath string functions, so that
nothing more than XSLT is needed to associate an IDREF with the object
having the associated ID.

If the main issue is conversion back and forth between DELTA and a
more XMLish tree-based representation, or generating from a database,
the complexity of such ID's is insignificant, because they are easily
managed programattically. However, if people actually *like* a
list-like format, and intend to markup XML by hand, then managing id's
may be more of a nuisance.

Dear TDWG folk - I sent the following note to Bob Morris but have since
thought that maybe I should have sent it to the whole list. So here it is.

-----------------------

Dear Bob

Something in the mail below caught my eye & I thought I should mention it
lest something at the foundation level be incorporated which is incorrect.

What I'm referring to is just below a row of *******'s below and copied
here:

>  > <taxonomy>
>  >      <rank="species" value="alfari"/>
>  >      <rank="genus" value="Azteca"/>
>  >      <author value="Emery"/>

What is referred to as "species" value="alfari"/ is actually the specific
epithet. The "species" value in this instance would actually be "Azteca
alfari" You're probably familiar with this protocol of referring to the
scientific name of an organism which implies citing the genus name & the
specific epithet which together comprise the species names - as per the
Linnean system of binomial nomenclature. Should I have the 'wrong end of the
stick' of the discourse at this stage then please advise me.

Sincerely,
- Leszek Vincent

Isn't this merely a matter of how we look at things and the insoluble
legacy of the Linnean system?

Conceptually one of way of dealing dealing with things is to consider we
are dealing with taxa, <taxon>, and that each taxon has a <name/>, <rank/>
and a context or parentage <parent/> which happens to be another <taxon> at
a higher <rank>.

Computers do not have any trouble with such a model and can build wonderful
and tidy tree-like hierarchies.

However, to make the thing humanly intelligible for the purposes of
communication, Names below the genus have to be specified with their
context because the same name are allowed in different genera.

Conceptually the species can be thought of as the thing - the taxon at the
rank of species.  it handle if the combination of its name and its context:
genus name plus species epithet, as you describe.

We could always use an name in connection and sometimes do, e.g.
Blechnaceae: Woodwardia, or Woodwardia (Blechnaceae), but mostly above the
level of genus we do not bother, maybe because people can remember where a
smaller number of things fit.

But there are undoubtedly equally valid ways of modelling species and their
names...

The truth is that we secretly conceptualize nodes in such trees as the
full path from the root of the tree. Hence to us the <speciesName> object
is the full taxonomy. However, it is quite easy in any of the
languages with which one might process XML to turn one form into the
other. We didn't intend to propose that markup as a standard. In each
biological community, the biologists will set a standard if they can't
live with one some other community has already made. And we computer
scientists get to clean up the mess. :-)

Whether or not this is a good example, it is widely understood that
you can't force a single standard on a group just because they seem to
have common interests. Biologists seem to be an ornery lot. If they
don't like something they go do it a new way. Which often actually
tends to advance matters!

Well, the above use to be true but not any more.  The latest version of the
Zoological Code drops all reference to "epithet" and now calls it the
"specific name" (Article 5 and Glossary under "Name" - epithet doesn't even
appear in the Index).

More to the point, to be absolutely proper (under the current ICZN) the
above would look like this:

<taxonomy>
    <rank="species" specific_name="alfari"/>
    <rank="genus" generic_name="Azteca"/>
    <author value="Emery"/>

But this would be a particularly unclever way of doing it.  If you wanted to
change it I would suggest de-generalising it a bit to:

<taxonomy>
    <specific_name="alfari"/>
    <generic_name="Azteca"/>
    <author value="Emery"/>

The rank element doesn't really contribute much since you'll need to parse
the "value" attribute to figure out what's going.  Might as well just get
the text of the "specific_name" element directly rather than searching for
the "rank" element that equals "species" and then getting the text of its
"value" attribute.  Yes, this change makes it more specific and less general
(and is a bad thing in strict IT terms), but why make life harder than it
has to be?  This way of doing it might make it harder to develop a Schema
definition, but I would argue strongly that the data model should come after
we know what we want to do, not before (<soap_box_on> and that's partly why
this discussion has drawn out for sooooo long - the BioLink team built a
complete XML representation of the BioLink database, some 400 fields in 50
tables, in 3 weeks and are now using it to move data between BioLink
databases and between Platypus and BioLink - and, surprise surprise, we
don't have a DTD or Schema because you don't actually need one to make this
stuff work <soap_box_off/>).

If you need to add a subgenus to the name just add a new element:

<taxonomy>
    <specific_name="alfari"/>
    <subgeneric_name="Alfaridris"/>
    <generic_name="Azteca"/>
    <author value="Emery"/>

I don't think this would cause any more confusion during processing or
parsing than:

<taxonomy>
   <rank="species" value="alfari"/>
   <rank="subgenus" value="Alfaridris"/>
   <rank="genus" value="Azteca"/>
   <author value="Emery"/>

If the software can't handle the first then it's unlikely to be able to do
much with the second either.  Yes, the Schema definition would be broken by
the first method and not the second, but this is a secondary consideration
to someone who wants to actually process this bit of pseudo-XML.  If I don't
know how to handle the element called "subgeneric_name" then I won't know
how to handle a rank with a value of "subgenus" either.  The point is that
the application and the data are tightly integrated (more than we would like
them to be) and if the two get out of synch things won't go smoothly.

Yours in confusion, Steve Shattuck

[Hey Steve, my soapbox is bigger than your soapbox... :-) ]

I reply:

Absolutely right. However, you almost never will see a need for a
Schema (or DTD) when you have a single data model and your
applications know it, as in the case you describe. If on the other
hand, you want to combine data from multiple data sources, you have an
advantage if there is a schema (small 's', meaning either an XML
Schema or a DTD). You can always infer a schema from an instance of
XML, (see Michael Kay's DTD generator at
http://users.iclway.co.uk/mhkay/saxon/saxon5-5-1/dtdgen.html), but if
you have an instance that isn't general, you'll get a schema that
isn't general.  In addition, if you are trying to write an application
that manipulates the node tree represented by an application, you also
have an advantage having a schema or otherwise knowing the data model.
I'll be startled if you wrote your exchange program with no knowledge
of the data model. The fact that such a program works independently of
a schema is part of the requirements of XML, but this says nothing
about what aid such a schema can offer either in writing applications,
or more interestingly, in generating applications.

For those in the camp that believe in publishing static XML---and
there are a lot of them---having a schema also is a big win for using
markup editors like XMLSpy. With a schema, these offer you only valid
tags at every point. Writing an application that is assured of working
against validated XML will often result in more robust applications
because they will not miss XML elements that are in the "wrong" place.

Validating against an XML Schema provides strong data typing and so
can help detect data errors.

Finally, XML Schema provides robust inheritance
mechanisms. Consequently if people derive a Schema from some series of
base Schemas, they automatically gain the use of applications written
against the base, even if they do nothing interesting to their
extensions. In my opinion, this reusability is highly valuable.

--Bob (Soapy) Morris

p.s.
I'd be interested to see what Kay's DTD generator gives against your
XML.

Thanks for the gentle reminder of where we are ultimately headed.

I guess I'm expressing some disappointment relating to the "bicycle vs.
space shuttle" problem discussed earlier.  The BioLink team have put
together quite a nice little bike and are now zoning around town having a
great time.  The SDD discussion seems to still be lying in a grassy field
(or on the railroad tracks?) gazing at the stars and dreaming of space
ships.

We're not even close to putting together a single data model that works with
even a single application, forget about sharing multiple data models across
multiple applications. Yes, that will come and I understand the power of it,
but let's get a system that can represent DELTA/Intkey and LucID data now,
the data we currently hold and the applications we currently use.  By all
means we should keep dreaming and planning and exploring.  And when new
applications appear and want to share or extend our data then we share and
extend it.  It's the classic problem of deciding when to put down the pencil
and paper and pick up the hammer and saw.  We've been at this for a year
now, it's time to get dirty.

Thanks, Steve Shattuck

P.S. - I'll give the DTD generator a try as soon as the current BioLink XML
import finishes.

Bob,

|
| <DESCRIPTION ID = "1">
| <FEATURE IDREF="1"> <VALUE IDREF="3">

|
| rather than
|
| <DESCRIPTION ID = "1">
| <FEATURE ID="1"> <VALUE ID="3">

It should probably be:
 <DESCRIPTION IDREF = "1">
 <FEATURE IDREF="1"> <VALUE IDREF="3">
 <FEATURE IDREF="2"> <VALUE IDREF="1">
 </DESCRIPTION>

Since the description is also referring to a defined taxon ID.

I think all values should be specifically named. It would be silly to have a
global "present", then have a feature "Flower colour" that allows this
feature value.

This is a nuisance. TDWGID I think is not a likely candidate.

Using your first option, one could use simply:
ID="1" (id for feature 1)
ID="1.2" (id for value 2 of feature 1)

This may then perhaps even be handy. Then again, by constraining like this
it would quickly become a nightmare to add or re-arrange features or values.

Is this the first case where we're being imposed upon by XML and we start to
wear the cost of its advantages? Are there any other ways out?

Rather than inserting 'ID' type elements within the XML, you could instead
define <xsl:key> elements in a xsl stylesheet and then use the XPATH  key()
function to access the values. The key() function works in pretty much
identical way as the XPATH id() function, but a key (unlike an id) doesn't
need to be unique.

Bob writes:

Having global named values doesn't imply that an application *must*
use them, only that it *may* use them. Also, this is one of those
places where having a schema (= DTD or X Schema) can help because it
is possible to define the schema in such a way that 'Flower colour
present' would be prohibited. In this case a validating XML parser
would signal exactly where the "error" lies, in case you care. But
even better, an application that was built to the schema but did not
enforce the schema would just ignore the silly statement.

TDWG subgroup: Structure of Descriptive Data, subgroup session at the TDWG=

meeting in Frankfurt, 12. Nov. 2000
## Version 1 ##

=3D=3D Participants =3D=3D
Stan Blum, Jim Croft, Gregor Hagedorn, Nicholas Lander, Bob Morris, J=F6rg=
 Ochsmann,
Richard Pankhurst, Jean-Marc Vanel, Mark Watson, Greg Whitbread, and other=
s

=3D=3D Discussion topic: What is this group about? =3D=3D
Bob Morris: =93Group is not interested in resource development.=94 Nichola=
s Lander: Not on
Standard Characters lists. There was a TDWG subgroup on Standard Character=
s for plants
(Richard Pankhurst was convener), which did not succeed to draw up a stand=
ard character
list. Richard Pankhurst thinks we should put it off for further 5 years un=
til Delta-like technology
is widely used and interest is sufficient.

=3D=3D Discussion topic: SDD future and presentation =3D=3D
Convener: Gregor Hagedorn apologized for his lack of initiatives during th=
e year, being
overwhelmed with work in the starting phase of the GLOPP project. He is wi=
lling to continue
as convener, but also willing to step aside if somebody else wants to fill=
 the position and bring
more initiatives into the group.

It was agreed that there should be a SDD website to point to information r=
esources
concerning the activities of the group. Nicholas Lander will ask Ben Richa=
rdson at Perth,
alternatively if Gregor Hagedorn continues as convener he can host the sit=
e on the
www.DiversityCampus.net server of the GLOPP project.

Most participants agreed that a true SDD workshop should be organized, las=
ting at least full 2
days, to clarify the issues brought up during the email discussions and re=
ach real understanding.
It was agreed that the email discussions are extremely good and useful, bu=
t that it is difficult to
fully assess where a consensus was reached, and where the discussion simpl=
y tapered off.
Also, certain concepts are easier discussed with physical presence, using =
graphical
presentations.

Such a workshop was considered to be desirable in the near future, latest =
immediately before
or after the next TDWG meeting. It should be organized in conjunction with=
 some other event,
to minimize traveling expenses in terms of time and money. Another time co=
uld be before or
after a workshop which is planned by the TDWG subgroup on Accession Data i=
n the spring of
2001.

The more technical discussions regarding implementation choices in XML sho=
uld be clearly
separated on the discussion list by the string =93XML=94. Perhaps a sub-su=
bgroup might be formed
to resolve questions in this area?

=3D=3D Discussion topic: Resource discovery =3D=3D
Bob Morris: We need to distinguish between questions that hinge on resourc=
e cost, and
questions that hinge on biological problems. Resource cost: does it pay to=
 try a given
information source whether it holds information. It should be easy to know=
 in advance whether
a server may hold the information I am looking for. New important developm=
ent reported by
Bob Morris: Uniform data description interface (UDDI). Nothing about resou=
rce cost has been
discussed so far, but group may address this issue. Some information about=
 this should be in
the header of a new XML files standard. It was agreed that this question i=
s secondary to the
interest

Information that should be present in the header of the files:
Taxonomic scope: What are the taxa I hold data on, either list, or query d=
efinition (query ->
sorry I hold no data)
Do I have descriptions? (e.g. unparsed natural language)
  Do I have structured descriptions? Which kind? e.g. DELTA/NEXUS/XML? or:=
 If so, point
me to where the structure of description is defined=85
Do I have media (images)?
Do I have keys or other means of identification?
  Do I have interactive keys?

=3D=3D Discussion topic: Who is interested in a new standard for descripti=
ve data? =3D=3D
We distinguished between 3 user/provider interests:
1) The pure user of electronic field guides, applying the descriptions e.g=
. to identification work,
2) The pure data provider, who holds large amounts of descriptive informat=
ion that is historical
and has the status of an unchanging publication
3) The data developing scientist, who creates and analyses/uses his or her=
 data. In contrast to
case 2, any data here must be referenced to individual sources and any inf=
ormation is under
contention of being false.

The case of 2 occurs e.g. in projects where legacy information like huge c=
onventional flora or
fauna works are digitized and shall be accessed in a structured way. In ca=
ses 1 and 2 the data
can be transformed in ways that may lead to some loss of information (e.g.=
 concerning the
source of individual assertions: "leaves are glandulous when young: observ=
ed by Author1,
1980"). However, the case 3 is interested in rigid structure to allow know=
ledge management
and data validation. The case 3 is the case assumed in programs like the C=
SIRO Delta
programs, Pankey/Pandora, or DeltaAccess which see themselves as working t=
ools for
scientists.

=3D=3D Discussion topic: XML markup as proposed by Kevin Thiele =3D=3D
Bob Morris raised the question whether Kevin Thiele=92s proposal would be =
enough to start with,
to which additional structural information can be added. Greg Whitbread th=
inks yes, but
character types should be added.

Gregor Hagedorn remarked that, without having objections against Kevin=92s=
 principal argument
about the advantages of providing a very simple system that could be used =
to markup existing
information, it was difficult to say whether the system would be compatibl=
e with a more
structured approach, as long as the structured approach is yet very vague.=
 However, it may be
wise to take Kevin=92s approach ahead, risking however to redefine it late=
r.

It was agreed that it is desirable to have a common standard which defines=
 levels of structure.
Gregor Hagedorn remarked that a software may require at least a certain st=
ructural level, e.g.
a structured database may require coded markup of character and feature, r=
eferring to a full
character schema. Levels should be clearly labeled, so that an application=
 can easily detect
whether there is sufficient structure for its needs. However, levels shoul=
d be known not only to
the software, but also to users so that scientists can communicate =93I ca=
n give you this, is this
ok for you?=94 Problems like those with versions of the DELTA standard (fo=
rmat changes, but
version not recognizable for importing software), or in the graphics area =
the =93TIF=94-problem
(the standard defines an envelope, which may contain any kind of informati=
on, including
proprietary formats unreadable for other software) should be avoided. Poss=
ible levels could be:

>> Level 0: The description is marked up as a block referring to a certain=

Gregor Hagedorn brought up the question whether the simpler, character sch=
ema-free forms
of  XML markup are able to cope with queries and reports in multiple langu=
ages. It seems to
him that the words of the language stand for only the English understandin=
g, without any
definition being available elsewhere. This is a contrast to the DELTA meth=
od of defining
characters and states, and using codes that can easily be output in multip=
le languages
concurrently.

Nicholas Lander: There is a file format standard, the "Star file" format (=
20 yrs old but dynamic
CODATA standard, now also in xml) in chemistry supplies means to define co=
re character
lists with supplements

=3D=3D Discussion topic: Discussion of future of DELTA format =3D=3D
Nicholas Lander: =93We need more rigorous system.=94 It was agreed to put =
efforts into the
original idea of developing a system that goes beyond DELTA and Nexus, but=
 encompassed
the functionality of NEXUS, DELTA/New DELTA, and adds the additional requi=
rements
identified by LucID or DeltaAccess. Richard Pankhurst warned about the gen=
eralized system
fallacy: Any system that tries to fulfill too many requirements will becom=
e very complex and
inherently difficult to analyze and maintain. There is a danger of creatin=
g a monster-structure
nobody will actually use.

@@ Question to participants: something was discussed about the Free Delta =
system, but I
missed that in my note. Anybody can fill in here?

=3D=3D Discussion topic: Standard character lists =3D=3D
Several members stressed the need for Standard character lists in the futu=
re. It was (who said
that??) proposed to start with core schemata that can be expanded as time =
goes on. Gregor
Hagedorn proposed that standards should not necessarily be seen as concent=
ric rings (e.g. a
single standard with successive versions or levels), but perhaps rather mo=
dular blocks that can
stand side-by-side. For example, it may be wise to develop and maintain st=
andards for different
methodologies (field observation, light microscope, SEM characters, chemic=
al compounds) by
different standard bodies. A given description could choose from the stand=
ard modules as
necessary for the observations or studies made.

Gregor Hagedorn: Standard character schema should be developed like scient=
ific publications,
so that they can be developed and improved by scientists in the course of =
several years. Only
after the contour of competing schemata have become clear, standardization=
 efforts should
begin.

=3D=3D Discussion topic: Character vs. Structure / feature  =3D=3D
The following discussion happened after a break necessary due to the colli=
sion of Bob Morris
presentation with the discussion. Many participants were absent during thi=
s part. Jean-Marc
Vanel presented his views about structural analysis of character data. It =
was first that it is
preferable to use the general term structure rather than the term =93organ=
=94 proposed by Jean-
Marc Vanel. Vanel proposed that structures can be hierarchical or primary/=
secondary. We
found, however, that structures have not necessarily a clear hierarchy. If=
 the same type of
hairs exist on both the stem and the leaf, it is not sufficient to place =93=
hairs=94 outside the group
containing both stem and leaf. It is possible that characters and structur=
es have overlapping
hierarchies, that can not be resolved into a simple tree. For example, the=
 same hairs may occur
on many different structures, which can not be grouped hierarchically. A R=
ef-ID mechanism is
necessary to document the relations between structures, substructures, and=
 properties. Vanel:
=93XML is like a Christmas tree: basic tree with decoration connecting bra=
nches=94.

Richard Pankhurst uses relational adjectives (=3D linguistic term): part-o=
f relationship and kind-of
relationship. Examples: =91Leaflet=92 is a part of a leaf. =91Basal leaf=92=
 is a kind of leaf; =91glume=92 is a
kind of leaf, but in more special sense.

Features have qualifiers. Richard Pankhurst further discussed restrictions=
 of context: plant is
young/old, ivy leaves: when young lobed, when old almost round. Certain co=
nditions are called
=93epitopic=94 child birth is possible only in female, and only in female =
that is pregnant and of
appropriate age.

Gregor Hagedorn stressed the importance of methods or methodology in addit=
ion to the
structure/basic property analysis performed by Diederich et al. The same c=
haracter may have
different states (or values/results) for different methodologies (e.g. sur=
face rough in SEM, but
smooth with hand lens). Methodology can further be split into =93observati=
on method=94 (type of
apparatus used) and =93condition=94 environmental or experimental method (=
soil, climate, culture
media, substrate, etc.). In some cases a character is implicitly only poss=
ible to observe using a
certain methodology.

Dear colleagues,

My apologies for posting the report on the TDWG meeting in Frankfurt only after a 2 weeks
delay. I did not manage to finish the report earlier, because I had too much work preparing for
an annual project meeting last Friday. Naturally, I remember better what I have said than what
others said, although I made a real effort to adequately take notes of other peoples
contributions. Any additions or corrections from those present at the discussion in Frankfurt
are most welcome! I will then repost a corrected report, which will also go to the TDWG
newsletter.

Hoping for your additions and corrections!

Gregor

Although I am the perpetrator of the mistake, UDDI does not stand for
Universial Data Description Interface, but rather Universial
Description, Discovery and Integration. See www.uddi.org.

UDDI is not about describing data, but about how you can find out
where and how to invoke services, e.g. databases, on the
web. Designed originally for Business-to-Business service discovery,
we are looking at it as a registry facility for biodiversity data
sources.

Here's some candy: we've built simple sample gateways to the USDA
Plants site and the Simthsonian Mammal Species of the World
site. Server-side perl makes up cgi requests to the site, parses
the returned html and emits XML. Of course, it is a very unstable solution since
changes to the site's html will break it. But we did it because we
experiment with federating heterogeneous XML biodiversity databases.

Nice work!!

I am wondering though, if you are federating heterogenous XML databases why
do you need to scrape the returned HTML but instead operate on the XML or
are they not XML enabled?

They are not XML enabled. We wish they were since both are pretty
interesting databases.

Virtually all major relational dbms now output XML, if crude, and
there is not really much reason people shouldn't be doing so on some
agreed upon alternative http port, say 8883. It's not critical to wait
for an agreed upon uniform schema to serve XML. it's even possible to
infer a schema or DTD from data instances, and anyway a schema or DTD
is not necessary to do much of what XML is good for. We hope people
will pay more attention to getting out their "raw" data in XML and
publishing their /query/ interfaces so that applications can use
them. When we do something like our gateway, we have to put a lot of
time into reverse engineering the query syntax because so many sites
believe that the only use of their data is through the forms they
provide, or some import of their entire dataset by a prior
arrangement.

I would advise against this... many institutional firewalls prohibit all
packets except through port 80... this would effectively prevent all of our
staff from playing with the outside world...  bummer, but them's the rules...

Sad, but true. We should kick around other ideas to solve this
problem, though a conventional port may be the easiest for data
sources to implement. How about:

- A convention whereby if
    http://<host>/<filePath>/<cgiquery>
yields HTML then
    http://<host>/<filePath>/xml/<cgiquery>
yields XML

-A convention whereby people set up virtual hosts---pretty easy in
most web servers---so that if
    http://<host>/<filePath>/<cgiquery>
yields HTML then something like
     http://xml-<host>/<filePath>/<cgiquery>
yields XML

Hopefully all of this is temporary, since a well crafted GBIF should
provide for discovery of URL, query syntax, and return schema. My real
point is that current versions of Oracle, SQL-Server, FileMaker, and
Access(?) can already emit XML without much(?) effort on the part of
the data source operators, and doing so would let people proceed to
build interesting distributed applications.

There are initiatives to resolve each of the issues brought up here that are
being worked on in several industry sectors:
1. Service discovery is addressed by UDDI (Universal Description,
Description and Integration).
2. Service description by WSDL (Web Service Description Language) which is
an XML document format for describing methods and data exposed by a web
services.
3. IGIR (Interface for Generic Information Retrieval) provides a generic
format for information retrieval via HTTP GET or POST requests that is easy
to implement.  The queries are sent as a structure easily translated into a
number of common query syntaxes (SQL for example).  Results are contained
within a consistently formatted document.  IGIR is optionally stateful (it's
up to the server to decide)- so a query that generates a very large result
set need not be sent back to the client all in one hit.  IGIR also supports
a SOAP interface (that's what it is originally designed for), so
programmatic access to information resources becomes pretty simple.

A search and retrieval scenario would work something like this:
A client hits on the UDDI directory, looking for services that support IGIR
and are "biologically relevant".  A list of services supporting IGIR are
returned, and the client broadcasts a query to them and waits for results to
start coming back.  Since the records are all formatted in a similar manner,
it is a simple process for the client to merge the results and present to
the user a nicely formatted set of results.

Anyway, that's how things should work.  To support a broadcast query,
obviously the targets must understand the contex of the query terms- so
groups within a particular domain (such as biological collections for
example) will need a set of "well known" access points (searchable fields).
Similarly, to simplify the merging of results that come back from such a
query, it would be convenient if there was an agreed record structure that
was shared between data providers.  The xml output by most database vendors
is a hack designed to allow easy transport of database records using http.
Things are getting better with xsd and so forth, but the structure of the
resulting xml documents will still reflect the structure of the databases
rather than any agreed upon common format.

Which brings us back to the "biological collections profile" concept that
was raised at the last TDWG meeting.  Would anybody like to volunteer a set
of access points (searchable fields) that are relevant for biological
collections?  Similarly for the record structure?  The DarwinCore elements
start to address these issues, but are somewhat deficient in several
respects.  They might make a reasonable starting place though- The
description with a comment section (add your gripes etc) is available at:
http://tsadev.speciesanalyst.net/DarwinCore/Darwin_core.asp

Most of you know that the DarwinCore was originally developed as a Z39.50
profile, hence some of the language may seem a little odd.  But the main
thing to take a look at is the list of access points- which are useful from
a biological collections point of view, and what's missing?

There are obviously other domains of biological databases beside just
collection databases.  Any suggestions for commonality between them all?

Cheers,
  Dave V.

<br>2. Service description by WSDL (Web Service Description Language) which
is
<br>an XML document format for describing methods and data exposed by a
web

<br>3. IGIR (Interface for Generic Information Retrieval) provides a generic
<br>format for information retrieval via HTTP GET or POST requests that
is easy
<br>to implement.&nbsp; The queries are sent as a structure easily translated

result
<br>set need not be sent back to the client all in one hit.&nbsp; IGIR
also supports
<br>a SOAP interface (that's what it is originally designed for), so
<br>programmatic access to information resources becomes pretty simple.
<p>A search and retrieval scenario would work something like this:

IGIR
<br>and are "biologically relevant".&nbsp; A list of services supporting
IGIR are
<br>returned, and the client broadcasts a query to them and waits for results
to

manner,
<br>it is a simple process for the client to merge the results and present
to
<br>the user a nicely formatted set of results.
<p>Anyway, that's how things should work.&nbsp; To support a broadcast
query,
<br>obviously the targets must understand the contex of the query terms-

Subject:      DIG35 Digital Image Metadata Standard
Comments: To: taxacom@usobi.org

The DIG35 Initiative Group is circulating for comment a Draft of
Version 1.1 of their metadata specificiation for digital images. See
http://www.digitalimaging.org/i_dig35.html

This extensive XML-based proposal standard allows the specification of
content metadata, colorimetric metadata including ICC color profiles
of the imaging system and characterization of the illuminant,
intellectual property rights (IPR), history of the image, capture data
including GPS data,...

This is very cool stuff, from a group whose members include Adobe,
Agfa, Kodak, Fujifilm, Canon, HP, and Microsoft.

Look into this if you are publishing images and want such things down the road as:

    -distributed catalog access
    -remote color rendering with a high likelyhood  looking like
the original
    -standardized IPR so that micropayment software can pay you
everytime somebody uses your image
    -ease of software comparison of your image to someone else's
    -....

Don't look into this if:

    - 200+ standards proposals turn you off
    - You want to wait until somebody builds the applications that
make use of standards and then you want to not care about the
standards, just the applications
    - You think XML is an American TV wrestling organization

<--Cross-posted to TAXACOM and TDWG-SDD -->

Version 1.0 is an excellent example of a metadata standard.  It is well
documented and (relatively) easily understood, AND strikes an excellent
(IMHO) balance between simplicity and completeness.  Highly recommended
reading for anyone designing databases (not necessarily image databases) or
working on data standards.

Unfortunately, the DIG35 group now charges $35(USD) for the PDF of version
1.0.  The draft of v. 1.1, however, is FREE.  (So get it now if you're
interested.)

Actually, "government and educational institutions" can get it free,
according to the web site. Probably most readers of TDWG and Taxacom
would qualify.

Subject:      "taxonomic rank" ?

Our Electronic Field Guide has data in which we organize a number of
sub-specific instances placing them in the hierarchy below the
species, but these are not sub-specific in the sense of, say, plant
varieties. Rather they are mainly sex and life-stage. I suppose
calling these a taxonomic rank would not please taxonomists, but I
wonder if there is any common terminology that encompasses both these
and conventional taxonomic ranks, with which we could conveniently tag
XML externally and object names internally.

At the end of June, the formation of the Interoperable Informatics
Infrastructure Consortium (I3C for short) was announced. So what is it? The
I3C's own material states "The I3C's mission is to facilitate and enable
data exchange, data management, and knowledge management across the entire
life science community by promoting common protocols that ensures
interoperability in an open, consistent and robust manner." The "common
protocols" are largely XML based. See http://i3c.open-bio.org/ for details.

Unfortunately, the "entire life science community" does not, at least at
this stage, appear to include taxonomists. The emphasis is strongly on
genomics, with a substantial side interest in drug discovery. Nevertheless,
this effort might be worth watching. It includes a number of heavyweights
from the IT industry (IBM, Sun, Oracle), along with major players in
pharmaceuticals and genomics, so there're a lot of resources to draw from.
Whether their efforts might someday extend to include taxonomy, and whether
taxonomists can learn from this initiative, remains to be seen. But that
mission statement does sound remarkably like that of TDWG...

Why aren't we trying to hook us onto this bandwagon? I think we do have a
real strong case with our systematics to make to be included in any of such
a system! Why just be passive? Why not draft a little memo to get in touch
with them, explaining what we do, how we could complement their efforts. If
they are in drug recovery, a good systematics is, or will become a very
important tool for them, as well as easily accessible description of taxa,
synonymies, distribution patterns and models.

Why be shy - we all think, we are important - so confess and come out!

Hi,

As an outside observer it seems like there's two approaches, to
either develop something as a grass-roots community effort
and build running code/consensus, and then work upwards to standardisation.
Or begin with a formal consortium and beginning defining
standards with code to follow.

The chemical community has taken the former approach, and
have been quite successful.

Dear TDWG folk

The note below caught my interest in that I'm a taxonomist/plant systematist
by vocation and am currently working in the area of ontology and controlled
vocabulary development for monocots & dicots (this is an extension of the
Gene Ontology paradigm - see: www.geneontology.org). Lest you're feeling
hopeless about the lack of taxonomists represented in this area of endeavor
(which overlaps I think with the I3C - I need to study it's mandate
further), there is my voice along with those of several other biological
ontologists who are collaborating with me. The relevance & inputs from
taxonomy/systematics are already being realised amongst some of my
colleagues - so there's hope. I'd argue that at least one taxonomist has
already got his 'sleeves rolled up' (IMHO) & is working with other
colleagues with similar goals (as being focused on by the I3C group). We're
hoping to form the Plant Ontology Consortium to extend our tools, paradigm &
'influence', for the benefit of the users of plant-based databases.

Subject:      SDD XML discussion in Sydney

I found last year that I was torn between the accessions working group
and the sdd working group, so
I wonder if anyone is interested in about a half-day pre-meeting
discussion of XML schemas/DTD for descriptive data on the afternoon of
November 8, to continue in the regular meeting. Based on our own
experience in our Electronic Field Guide project, my current belif is
that descriptive data will generally need much smaller schemas than
accession data, largely because

(a). the latter is likely to have tags for a lot of stuff descriptive
pages need anyway and (b). mostly what is needed is some stuff to be
able to provide data typing information to characters. XSchema is
quite good at this.

Because of (a) I will lobby in the accessions group for a clean
separation of markup that's about biological and spatio/temporal
concepts from markup that's about records. It may be that events,
e.g. collection events is another area of overlap. Indeed, one focus
of a premeeting might be to take the output of the accessions work and
see what overlap there is in desired markup.

Dear colleagues,

this message is from the so-called convener of the sdd group, who feels very guilty about his
incapacity to organize more and invest more work.

As you probably know, the topic of the group is very close to my interest, being also the topic
of my proposed thesis. However, in my current situation this seems to make it rather more
difficult for me. The GLOPP project I am leading here in Germany is over demanding my
resources, i.e. the project is in danger of failing. I can not keep the deadlines there, and I do
not find the time to continue the thesis work. So SDD has become part of a big guilt complex. I
would love to do more, but I am afraid I have not done enough for a long time now.

So, I will be at the TDWG congress in Sydney, and I hope we have a working group discussion
there. If anybody wants to take up the lead of the group, she or he will have my support for
that task.

I hope we can still use the time in Sydney for fruitful discussions!

Best wishes

Gregor

Bob had asked about a pre-meeting, which was difficult to organize because=
 of
two other premeetings, one about accessions.

I propose to get some extra working time by meeting Sunday after the tdwg
meeting at about 13:00 for a joint lunch, with open end for those who are
staying anyway. I will be available during the afternoon for anybody who
wants to join me. Depending on the interest, I will either either try to
organize a room, or we could just move into a caf=E9.

Please contact me on the meeting if you are interested.

If character are defined with an id (numeric or character) in one
file, and the item descriptions use these ids through idref or
through xml-schema keyref means:

How can a validating parser validate the schema, including keyrefs,
without having to include the entire character definition in each of
1000s of taxon description xml files? Can the ids for idref/keyref be
declared to be in a separate file?

I could not find a standard xml-include command. I know there is one
defined for dtds, but that is all I could find.

Can the xml experts help?

This is a means to separate out a schema into multiple files,
if I understand Gregor correctly he's asking for a way to test for
id/keyref uniqueness across multiple files?

If so, then you can include chunks of XML in other documents
using the dtd entity mechanism -- which is what I believe he
has already tried. I don't believe there's actually an equivalent
for XML Schema: you still need a DTD.

At a higher level there is XInclude which allows for including
content from one document into another. Not sure on
current support for this however.

(Assuming I'm on the right track) You may want to consider
using an additional validation mechanism here, such as XLinkIt [1]
which can make assertions (e.g. id uniqueness) across multiple
documents.

Hope that helps,

Gregor,

        My understanding of XML is that indeed, the character name
and states should be written out fully in all descriptions.  Characters
and states should not be placed in a separate file aws in DELTA.  The
'efficiency' of the DELTA model is really a trade off optimizing storage
over processing.  The makers of the XML model deliberately chose not to
optimize storage and to create wordy XML files to optimize processing. File
storage is not viewed as being a limiting factor any more, as it was when
DELTA was designed.

        There are a few ways to include data from other files and DTD's but
these are best used to create templates and allow for differently structured
DTD in the same document.  Say you have a DTD describing a taxonomic paper.
That DTD can easily reference separate DTD's for taxonomic nomenclature,
plants specimens,
and taxon descriptions, combining the results which can then be transformed
into a full taxonomic treatment.

        I think it is a mistake to try to directly translate the DELTA data
model into XML.  The XML model is different.  It is more flexible, more
readable, and
more easily processed.  It can also model hierarchies, though its relational
capabilities are
poor. The focus should be on developing a good XML model of taxonomic
data.  If necessary, it can be easily translated into DELTA format, or any
other format, using XSL and can be processed by the available XML tools.

Dear Kerry,

I can not see how what you propose could work. The name of a
character is not necessarily unique across different taxa, and often
not even within a taxon. Further the character concept and its names
(technical, laymen, English, German, etc.) are a 1:n relation. The
name can not stand for the character, only a code can. I do not care
whether this code is characters or numbers, but I believe it is a
mistake to think if something is <haircolor></haircolor> to take the
code at face value and assume you know what are hairs and what is
color. Hairs are quite different things in plants, animals, or fungi,
and color needs information whether it is a code from a color
comparison chart, or an undefined term like "red".

I think I am sticking less with a DELTA storage optimization model,
but with a relational information model, which is what I have been
using for all my projects. The relational model allows language
independence. How can you preserve that, without having unique codes
that lead to the definition of a character?

That does not mean, that a free text description in some language,
say Chinese, may be present, in addition to the data. That is why I
am thinking of attributes, not element data.

I think this is not possible. If I understand correctly, you are
referring to schema, not idref in one xml document referring to id
defined in another document. The schema would define the fact that
two attribute (say cid and cidref) have to be interpreted as key and
keyref, but not the actual values.

Yes, and data files, not schema/dtd. One xml data file defines ids,
the other points to these ids. In the case of descriptive data, 1000s
of item description files should all point to the same, centrally
defined character definitions.

I think this comes closest. Can you point me to information on
XInclude? As you say, it seems unclear whether a validating parser,
say msxml 4.0 would be able to check such id/idrefs.

Both Apache Cocoon and Microsoft .NET claim to support XInclude but I
am not sure if there are any pure client-side implementations. Also, it is
unclear at (another too quick) glance what the validation issues may
be with either of these.

I'll try to summarize the discussion we had during the field trip, maybe it
will be clearer for everyone.

You want to have a descriptors file (the model), validated against a
descriptors schema. And a taxons file, validated againt a taxons schema. But
you also want to ensure coherency between the model and the taxons, such as
referencing the correct descriptors, or the correct descriptors states.

One way would be to use XSLT to performs this additional coherency
enforcement. You can include the descriptors file in the taxons file before
validating it, you can search for aberrant xpath statement result, etc...

The other way i would suggest would be to drop the static taxons schema, and
dynamically generate it from the descriptors file using XSLT. Then you'll
have one-step validation. But no more generic descriptive model.

BTW, the second approch is the one used by IKBS project
(http://www.univ-reunion.fr/ikbs), even if they don't use XML.

The character definition for a class of taxa, including the list of valid
states could be included as part of the character-schema. An "include" can
be used to insert the character schema within a taxon schema. The character
schema would allow the validator to enforce the limitations on any
particular xml instance file. As pointed out by Kerry Barringer I do not
believe that there is a need in XML to use an additional level of
indirection to include the item definitions in another file. This will cost
space but there is nothing to keep the XML from being stored in a
relational database and constructed on the fly as needed. If we want to
enforce relational normalization it might best be done in the underlying
database not in the xml instantiation of a view of the data.

It might be cleaner if the XML validator could do this but for the purposes
of data interchange and even interoperability, I think it is still useful
for the xml validator to be able to check the xml documents even without
the relational constraints. What is lost is that if you are moving data
from one database to another, a program might not be able to easily
recognize data relations and the receiving database might inefficiently
save the data in a different database structure from the originating database.

Gregor,

        We disagree and I'd like to get to the reason why because I am sure
that both of us are not fully understanding what the other is saying.

        I agree that a character name is not necessarily unique across
different
taxa.  A character is what a person defines it to be.  But I don't
understand
what you mean when you say that the name cannot stand for the character,
that only a
code can.  This seems absurd.  I don't see the difference between my 'name'
and
your 'code', especially when your code is just a compact coding that refers
to a
name.

        In your haircolor example, I think you are misunderstanding the
hierarcical
nature of XML coding.  Each character is part of another, which all
eventually are
part of a 'root,' in our case probably a plant. So the character 'Plant' has
the characters
'stems.' 'leaves,' etc.  'Leaves" may contain the character 'trichomes'
which may contain
the character 'color.'

        If I understand what you wrote, your criticism applies to a
relational model where
the character of 'aircolor' might be used for leaf trichomes, fine enations
inside a fruit,
or the body covering of mammals.  It is impossible to define a character
this way
in an XML file because it is strictly hierarcical, not relational.

        If you feel that descriptive data can only be modeled with
relations, then you
can never get XML to work for you.  It is not relational, it is strictly
hierarcical. It
does not and, by design, cannot support the relational model.  Do not
confuse XML with a
database.  It is -not- designed to be a database.  The few databases that
use XML are all
hierarcical XML is designed to model the structure of
documents.  If you want to create a database, use a database language.  XML
is what you use in the report.

        My feeling is that the hierarcical nature of XML might be suitable
for plant descriptions.
I know it does a good job coding taxomomic papers and taxonomic
nomenclature.  It is
less suitable, though still workable, for specimen data, which is easier to
model with
relational tables.

        To use XML though, I think we must look outside the DELTA model of
character coding. XML
won't improve the DELTA model or fix its faults.  We must also look beyond
the database model. Plant descriptions are highly structured documents.  XML
can model that structure.

        Finally, we have to get beyond the wordiness of XML files.  They are
designed to be that
way.  we can only live with it.

        Let me know if this makes sense and be sure to correct me if you
feel I am being
too stupid.

all the best,


Kerry

Dear Kerry,

I can not see how what you propose could work. The name of a
character is not necessarily unique across different taxa, and often
not even within a taxon. Further the character concept and its names
(technical, laymen, English, German, etc.) are a 1:n relation. The
name can not stand for the character, only a code can. I do not care
whether this code is characters or numbers, but I believe it is a
mistake to think if something is <haircolor></haircolor> to take the
code at face value and assume you know what are hairs and what is
color. Hairs are quite different things in plants, animals, or fungi,
and color needs information whether it is a code from a color
comparison chart, or an undefined term like "red".

I think I am sticking less with a DELTA storage optimization model,
but with a relational information model, which is what I have been
using for all my projects. The relational model allows language
independence. How can you preserve that, without having unique codes
that lead to the definition of a character?

That does not mean, that a free text description in some language,
say Chinese, may be present, in addition to the data. That is why I
am thinking of attributes, not element data.

Well strictly speaking XML can be used to model/serialise graph structures,
so while it is hierarchical, and the syntax does require a single root,
there's
no reason why this can't become a graph (or other) structure once parsed.

There's been a lot of activity (unsurprisingly) in serialising XML into and
out of databases. In general it's not an easy problem to solve, but it
can be done.

Also, I'd have to disagree with the statement that 'the few databases
that use XML are all hierarchical'. Current XML-aware databases fall into
two categories: XML-Enabled Databases (i.e. relational databases that
have added XML features) and Native XML Databases (i.e. those specifically
designed to store XML). Databases in the first category do tend to be
primarily relational in nature. Those in the second are a mixture: they
model
the XML document internally, and this might be achieved using a relational
model.

Cheers,

L.

As an outside, but interested, observer I'm keen to contribute
to this discussion in any way that seems useful. E.g. technical
help with XML.

Judging by the recent discussion there is progress being made
on this front. Is there any publically available documentation?

I'll also interject 2p/euro/cents at this point:

I believe I'd tackle this problem firstly from a modelling perspective:
can we agree upon, and define a model for the data that we're
capturing. It seems like there is a conceptual model inherent in the
data currently captured by DELTA and other formats, that is
separate to the details of its syntax.

Having agreed a particular model, a suitable syntax for expressing
that model would be the logical next step. XML seems like a good
fit for this, and, as I've noted elsewhere, can serialise graphs of
information.

Cheers,

L.

People interested in how easily it can always be done, but why it is
hard to do it well in general, might consult S. Abiteboul, P. Buneman,

There seems to be a number of problems being addressed in the current
discussion:

1) Gregor's original post asked for a solution ("how do I do an include in
XML") without posing a problem ("how do I maintain a separate global
character list and link a number of independent taxon descriptions to it").
I would suggest that using an "include" is only one of a range of solutions
to this problem.  And if this isn't the problem then we should revisit it
before spending too much time coming up with a solution.

2) Whether XML is hierarchical or relational is of little importance in
practice.  All major relational databases can suck in and spit out XML -
it's a non-issue from an implementation standpoint (which is what we are
ultimately concerned with here).  IDs and RefIDs are primary and foreign
keys - the mapping is one-to-one if you want to structure the XML that way.

3) Leigh is spot-on when he says "define a model for the data" as this is
"separate to the details of its [the model's] syntax".  The syntax (= XML
model) will be useless if it doesn't manage the information that's important
to us no matter how "rigorous" or "technically accurate" it is.

4) At the Sydney meeting I thought we agreed to restart this discussion with
specific examples based on real-life characters (in the biological sense).
This current thread would seem to be very much a continuation of the one
started 2 years ago: 80% focus on solutions (largely round XML syntax) and
20% on specific problems (addressing business needs).  I fear we'll end up
the same place we were before.

Thanks, Steve

P.S. - A solution to Gregor's problem would be to use unique identifiers
(GUIDs) in his global character list.  Any one using this list would then
include these identifiers as part of taxon descriptions along with metadata
(a citation) to find where the global list is housed.  If you then want to
combine separate description datasets you can compare the character
identifiers: if they are the same then it's the same character, if they are
different then it's not the same character.  It's a simple, foolproof
solution that's easy to implement technically (whether people will actually
do this is a completely different matter ;-) ).

P.P.S. - I'm well aware that I have the power to direct this discussion by
actually doing what I suggest in No. 4 above.  And I really, really intend
to do it.  I just have one more meeting to get through, and then another 10
emails, and then ....

Amen.

I'm not a taxonomist, but I suggest that several folks on this list take some
of their current character data and make an example out of it in XML and
comment on the example.  It need not be perfect.  This could quickly educate
others about the strengths and potential weaknesses of an approach with a
specific examplar.

XML will make it very nice to move data between different applications,
or between component parts of a large application.  I just want to write
nifty plant/insect applications against the XML-wrapped character data.

Going right off for a perfect Holy Grail has sabotaged other group projects in the past.
One of the best examples is how Algol language folks got into bitter debates about
when an object is a chair and when it's a table.

Amen. More explicitly, what was posed was to provide "data challenges",
i.e. (as I understood) problems about characters that the poser feels
important to model. Implicit (as I understood) in that
discussion---and in almost all of this recent thread---is that a
particular representation (e.g. XML) is NOT what is initially desired.
If, indeed, my understandings were correct, and if a sufficiently
inclusive set of challenges were identified, what would then be
accomplished sets the stage exactly for the modeling Leigh
urges. Further, this complies with one of the admonitions in Rob
Atkinson's talk to first find out what you are trying to make a
standard about, i.e.:

 <not>
   <adage>XML is the answer. What is the question?</adage>
 </not>

Finally, I would paraphrase what I understood the subgroup meeting
arrived at:

     The first job is to identify with these data challenges the
     strengths and the limitations of what DELTA-motivated
     applications can accomplish, rather than throw out the experience
     of DELTA and start over.

Probably Gregor's meeting minutes will reveal whether that understanding
is correct and perhaps how it came to be.

Below and attached are a first attempt at representing simple, common
DELTA-type data in an XML-based structure.  I've used a selected set of
characters and items from the Butterfly sample data on the DELTA web site.
The DELTA-formatted data looks like this:


==== DELTA-Standard CHARS File ====

*SHOW: Lepidoptera demonstration characters. Revised 28-AUG-91.

*CHARACTER LIST

#1. main colour of inner part of front wing/
       1. white/
       2. cream/
       3. grey/
       4. brown/
       5. black/
       6. yellow/
       7. orange/
       8. blue/
       9. green/

#2. wings <transparency>/
       1. with transparent areas/
       2. without transparent areas/

#3. length of front wing/
       mm/

#4. antennae <length>/
       times length of front wing/


==== DELTA-Standard ITEMS File ====

*SHOW: Lepidoptera demonstration items. Revised 18-OCT-94.

*ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

# Antheraea/
1,4 2,2 3,43-50 4,0.15-0.2

# Ethmia/
1,2-4 2,2 3,11-14 4,0.6-0.65

# Graphium/
1,1-2/9 2,2 3,29-33 4,0.45-0.5

# Hecatesia/
1,4 2,1<small, translucent window>/2 3,11-14 4,0.8-0.9


==== DELTA-Standard SPECS File ====

*SHOW: Lepidoptera demonstration specifications. Revised 28-AUG-91.

*NUMBER OF CHARACTERS 4
*MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STATES 9
*MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITEMS 4

*CHARACTER TYPES 3,RN 4,RN

*NUMBERS OF STATES 1,9




==== For these files, the DELTA-generated natural language would look
something like this:

Antheraea
Main colour of inner part of front wing brown. Wings without transparent
areas. Length of front wing 43-50 mm. Antennae 0.15-0.2 times length of
front wing.

Ethmia
Main colour of inner part of front wing cream to brown. Wings without
transparent areas. Length of front wing 11-14 mm. Antennae 0.6-0.65 times
length of front wing.

Graphium
Main colour of inner part of front wing white to cream, or green. Wings
without transparent areas. Length of front wing 29-33 mm. Antennae 0.45-0.5
times length of front wing.

Hecatesia
Main colour of inner part of front wing brown. Wings with transparent areas
(small, translucent window), or without
transparent areas. Length of front wing 11-14 mm. Antennae 0.8-0.9 times
length of front wing.




==== Hand-generated natural language would be essentially the same except
for the last item, where it might look more like this:

Hecatesia
Main colour of inner part of front wing brown. Wings with or without
transparent areas (when present, forming a small window). Length of front
wing 11-14 mm. Antennae 0.8-0.9 times length of front wing.


============================================

I've translated this into the XML file that is attached.  (Even this fairly
simple example is moderately large and I would recommend using an XML viewer
such as Microsoft's XML Notepad when working with it - see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnxml/html/
xmlpaddownload.asp.)

The basic structure of the attached file is:

<Morphology>
   <Characters>
      <Character> - ANY NUMBER
         <Type>
         <ID>
         <Short_Descriptor>
         <Long_Descriptor>
         <State_Descriptor>
         <Order>
         <State> - ANY NUMBER
            <Value>
            <ID>
            <Order>
   <Items>
      <Item> - ANY NUMBER
         <Type>
         <ID>
         <Descriptor>
         <CodedCharacter> - ANY NUMBER
            <CharacterID>
            <Description>
            <CodedState> - ANY NUMBER
               <StateID>
               <Value>


Note that I've treated everything as elements and haven't used attributes.
Simplicity is the only reason for this and some elements would be better as
attributes; these can be converted when the dust settles.

I've tried to generalise as much as possible and use only two main elements:
<character> and <item>.  Each character is assigned a <type> that tells what
it is (ordered multistate, unordered multistate, real, integer, etc).
Similarly the item <type> can be specified as taxon or specimen (or
potentially something else).

A couple of points are probably worth making:

The <Short_Descriptor> and <Long_Descriptor> are used to support DELTA
comments.  This probably needs to be generalised further to support any
number of alternate phrasings.

<State_Descriptor> is used for the units of numeric characters and isn't
needed (?) for other character types - it's an attempt at keeping
<character> general.

The <Description> element in <CodedCharacter> is used to house natural
language representations. Codes for the states (when needed) are placed in
square brackets, these being translated during generation.  As noted above,
this may been to be generalised to support any number of phrasings.

In <CodedState>, <Value> is used to hold numeric values, the <character>
<state> being used to define what the number means (minimum, maximum, etc.,
rather than using placement in the attribute string as in the DELTA
standard).  This element won't (?) be needed for multistate characters.

I think/hope the remainder is fairly clear.


** The Next Step **

I would suggest the following path from here:

1) Make sure the above representation makes sense for the data given.

2) Expand the above data to support LucID-specific requirements (without
adding additional complexity).

Once this is finished we can:

Add additional DELTA features (dependencies, default values, etc.)

Add more complex data sets and examples

Add new features on our assorted "wish lists"


I look forward to comments and forward progress!

I'm always surprised seeing people recommend using proprietary stuff, when
they are plenty of free-software equivalents:

sourceforge.net also also provide a complete list

This is a mixed approach, whereas Gregor's proposition is to separate
characters description and items. Morevoer, it's closely related to delta (as
xdelta), whereas everyone seems to agree on building something from scratch.

No, there is also a performance argument for attributes: as they make files
less verbose, parsing is quicker. See xerces-j/xalan-j FAQ.

However, from a modeling point-of-view, the rule should be:
use elements for what is has real-world meaning
use attributes for modeling artifacts (id, idrefs, etc...)
Default XSLT transformation enforces this by outputting elements contents and
ignoring attributes.

I wholefully agree there: let's define first a conceptual model, then we
should discuss of its implementation.

However, we must agree on model extend: will it concerns only concept
description (aka: characters) or also case description (aka: items) ? IMHO,
only the first one can be generalized, or we'll have to validate the case
description twice: against a generic model and against its concept.

For using an exemple, if i have a description of the characters of
Pociloporidae familiy, and a description of the items of Pociloporidae
family, i'll have to make sure characters are really characters (validating
against generic character model), to make sure items are really items
(validating against generic items model), and make sure Pociloporidae items
are really Pociloporida (validating items against characters). I would prefer
to have only to validate characters againt a generic character model, and
validate items against characters, meaning using a character description as a
suitable model for items description.

This nicely demonstrates the point that the syntax is
only a way to encode a particular model. I'd previously
cast the same basic Lepidoptera data into XML (with
some additional data, such as images) using XDelta:

http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ccslrd/delta/lep.xml

I'm sure the following is wrong in places and/or overly simplistic,
and deliberately so:

A Character has
 - a Character Type (one of Ordered or Unordered or Real, or ...)
 - a Character Identifier (a number)
 - a Short Description (free text)
 - a Long Description (free text)
 - an Order Identifier (a number)
 - a State Descriptor (free text)

A State has
  - a State Value (free text)
  - a State Identifier (a number)
  - an Order Identifier

An Item has
  - An Item Type (free text)
  - An Item Identifier (a number)
  - A Description (free text)
  - One or more Characteristics (observed values of states for
    specific characters)

Characters describe a list of properties for some Type of Thing
might have. States describe the list of (observed) values
of that property for a specific Type of Thing (avoiding the
word Class as it's an overloaded term).

An Item is the specific instances of those properties, with
some specific Thing.

What did I get wrong?

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Welcome back!

I actually posted this message a week ago, but my email address has changed
slightly, and the list server rejected me. So here it is again.

At the Sydney TDWG meeting we agreed that we would continue with the SDD
discussion on this list, but try to keep a tighter focus. The last active
period (about 12 months ago) was an important brainstorm session, but didn't
seem to be very effective at actually getting us to the goal of a workable
standard.

We decided this time to try working through some challenge cases - real or
made-up instances of descriptive data that need to be accommodated in the
standard. By agreeing first on a +/- complete set of challenges, then
working through the challenge cases in order from simple to difficult, we
should be able to reasonably bound our problem while keeping an overview of
the territory while actually sinking out teeth into the nitty-gritty.

Attached is my first attempt at a set of challenge cases, presented in +/-
this form to the Sydney meeting. The first challenge case has an exemplar,
the others have not yet. This document as it's worked up will be placed on
the TDWG web site for working reference. As the standard evolves, this will
also be put up on the site, possibly with progressive status indicators for
parts of the standard (e.g. working, proposed, normative - may we one day
get to normative)

I suggest that we should first add to or modify the list of challenges.
Propose a challenge (with exemplar) to add to the list. Once we are happy
with an approximate list of challenges (keeping in mind that others will
become clear as we proceed, so there's no need to agonise over this step),
we'll start with challenge 1. We'll throw up the challenge, give a week or
so for contributors to propose data structures that can meet the challenge,
then compare and discuss alternate solutions.

Gregor I think will shortly be posting a summary of the meeting discussions.
We agreed, I believe, that the goal is to provide a standard that can
adequately address the descriptive data requirements (ie be a superset) of
all existing programs (e.g. Lucid, DELTA, DELTA Access, Biolink) but not be
limited to existing programs. It should be able to function as an
interchange standard, but should not be limited to that. Bob Morris agreed
to provide shortly a discussion on interchange vs interoperability standards
and conflicts that may arise in trying to allow for both goals. We agreed
that XML will be the basis for the standard.

May the force be with us!

Cheers - k

First, I see Kevin has proposed a process slightly different to the one I
started on Friday.  I would suggest that we focus on one of these rather
than running both at the same time.  I don't think it matter which one we
follow as they both have pros and cons.  My idea was to start simple and
build as we go while Kevin's is to scope the project first then fill in the
details.  Any strong views on the process.

Guillaume commented that he's "always surprised seeing people recommend
using proprietary stuff" in response to my suggestion of using Microsoft's
XML Notepad (which, by the way, is actually free).  The point I was trying
to make was that XML can get complicated very quickly and using an XML view
(of any sort) is better than using a text editor.  Nothing more.

He also commented that my example "was closely related to delta (as xdelta),
whereas everyone seems to agree on building something from scratch".  I
fully agree, but I would suggest that DELTA has it basically right and that
whatever we develop will look suspiciously like DELTA.  For years
taxonomists have talked about things called "characters" with "states" and
have used these to build "descriptions" (= DELTA attributes).  DELTA is
firmly founded in taxonomic practices and since this is driving this process
I would be surprised if they diverge too far.  In other words there's a
reason DELTA has been as broadly accepted as it has and we shouldn't ignore
this.

Guillaume's final comment, about the use of XML elements and attributes, is
important but I still think it can wait.  There often isn't a clear
distinction between information that "has real-world meaning" and that which
is "modelling artefacts."  ["One person's data is another person's
metadata."]  The fact that "default XSLT transformation enforces this by
outputting elements contents and ignoring attributes" is too application
specific.  Many people process XML using DOM tools and they shouldn't be
constrained just because XSLT does it another way.

Leigh's comments are good and worth a detailed look.  His
model/representation/syntax (or whatever you want to call it) of the same
data I used (see http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ccslrd/delta/lep.xml) is exactly the
kind of thing I had in mind.  Does his representation make more sense than
the one I proposed?  What are the strengths/weaknesses of our approaches.
Does one allow us to get to where we want to be?  Again, I don't think the
exact syntax is important at this stage.  For example, both models describe
the meaning of the numbers present in item descriptions for numeric
characters, Leigh as "<value start="0.5" end="0.55" />" and myself as
"<CodedState StateID=C3S1 Value=0.5 /> <CodedState StateID=C3S2 Value=0.55
/>" with the meaning stored with the state rather than the item description.
At the syntax-level these are very different but at the modelling-level they
are the same - the same information is being managed (and both differ from
the current DELTA-standard in this regard).  We will need to work on the
syntax but let's get the model agreed to first, then worry about specific
syntax.

I believe this misses the goals of this project in a number of important
ways and we should avoid going down this path.  It seems to mix the (i)
processing of the data with (ii) the data representation with (iii)
taxonomic work practices.  I'm very uncomfortable going there.


Finally, Peter's concerns are important for the next step, expanding the
proposed representation to include information not currently managed.  One
of the strong recommendations from SDD Round 1 was to manage raw data.  This
needs to be housed under the summarized data (in this case, the actual
measurements under the ratios).  We WILL need to do this eventually.

Peter also pointed out possibly our largest challenge. He noted that "having
clear spots in wings is not very
precise if the data is to be comparable beyond the group in question - which
I suppose is part of the goal."  At every TDWG meeting I've been to we
decide that we can't build standards for specific character values and yet
at every TDWG meeting I've been to we try to build standards for specific
character values.  We need to build mechanisms to allow sharing of character
lists across projects IF THOSE PROJECTS WANT TO USE THIS FEATURE.  If
projects don't want to share character lists, for what ever reason, then
they won't not matter how important we think it is to do so.

<soapbox on>
I think this focus on "standard character lists" is very much a "plant
thing."  In animals it would never occur to me to use "clear spots in wings"
for anything other than the local context for which it was established.  No
one would suggest that "clear spots in wings" in bees has anything to do
with "clear spots in wings" in butterflies and trying to use a single
character coding for this would receive limited support at best.  I think
the problem is that it's common to talk about "identifying a plant" but very
rare to talk about "identifying an animal."  There are no "faunas" that are
equivalent to "floras."  This very fundamental difference between plants and
animals and the way people view them has a huge impact on this very
development - it's one of the reason's that the botanical community has
accepted DELTA much more strongly than the zoological community.  While a
"global flora" is a completely reasonable goal, a "global fauna" isn't even
a faint blip on distant radar.  Zoologists work in relative isolation
compared to botanists and have very different work practices and needs.
Meeting the needs of both of these communities will be a significant
challenge, one I'm not sure we can meet in a single set of tools.

The "data challenges" process was what was agreed in Sydney. Also, it
corresponds closely to processes generally regarded as successful in
software design, namely Use Case analysis, though it focuses on the
use and not the user (in the sense of both human and software).

Also, MSIE is a reasonable XML viewer, albeit not an editor.

In Sydney it was agreed that DELTA experience and functionality should
not be ignored, i.e. we should not start from scratch. [I don't happen
to agree with that because of the large community outside TDWG that is
already heavily involved in descriptive data if only informally. But
it is what was decided, and it does leverage the experience of most of
SDD. The trick will be to not arrive at something that only models DELTA]

Not only can it wait, but these things are possibly technical enough
that they shouldn't be initially in this mailing list. We are nearly
finished an installation of vBulletin forum software and will offer
to operate a forum off this list for discussion of the technical bits.

To the extent these are separable, there would probably be less
dispute about character representation. Probably this means that lots
of case description models have to fit on the same character model.

As a not biologist, this sounds right to me.

I agree with this. Whether sharing character lists matters may be a
function of the purpose of the list. For example, paper field guides
to a given group of taxa often have a far greater commonality of
description of characters than they do of characters. And they often
come equipped with a character metadata section that explains how to
use the characters.

Shattuck's and Dodd's proposals indeed seem basically identical (with XDELTA
deserving priority, since it has been presented first; it also seems a little
bit more detailed than Shattuck's proposal).

What I miss is an integration of the morphological data representation with the
representation of the taxonomic hierarchy (that has never been properly dealt
with by DELTA) in a single XML format for the purpose of storing and exchanging
taxonomic datasets. Gilmour's "Taxonomic Markup Language"
(http://www.albany.edu/~gilmr/pubxml/ ) could provide a good start in this
direction.

I would appreciate very much any comments in this connection.

My feeling is that taxonomic hierarchy is best got by web applications
from services such as ITIS or other web services offering XML. There
is a large community of descriptive data consumers, e.g. field
naturalists, that find taxonomic hierarchy generally
uninteresting. IMO, trying to integrate it with descriptive data
actually addresses a small group of applications at a cost of added
complexity.

"There is a large community of descriptive data consumers, e.g.
field naturalists, that find taxonomic hierarchy generally
uninteresting."

Bob, this comment needs a little bit more explanation /
discussion.

Without arguing _where_ the field naturalist and other consumers
should get their taxonomic hierarchical information, I'd want to
argue that such information is (should be!) anything but
"uninteresting" to many (most?, all?) consumers, in their work
of understanding who is present in their study worlds and why.

Having access to purported (evolutionary) relationships of their
study organisms focuses a special, valuable, most "interesting"
light on their studies. These users need to find these taxonomic
relationships handily, somewhere. In that context, your question
--Where?-- is probably a fair one to ask.

Certainly end users need this and many kinds of information.
We believe in integrated applications that discover or know where to
find the answers to questions like this. See our toy demo
http://www.cs.umb.edu/efg/xml1/DEVELOP/itis/demo.htm (This requires
MSIE, but it is perfectly possible---and probably better---to support
this kind of thing at the server.

I subscribe to the belief that simplicity is superior to complexity,
especially since much of the infrastructure now available to XML-based
applications means that much of the programming to support gathering
information from disparate sources is provided in the toolkits.

To pick a field guide at random (or rather, what's at hand): the
National Audubon Field Guide to Insects and Spiders has almost no
taxonomy above Order (it does mention that the insects are in Class
Insecta and Phylum Arthropoda; no mention of Subphylum, Subclass,
Superorder, Suborder or other arcana easily found from ITIS). In my
experience, field guide books may have a little nod toward taxonomy
above Family (or Order if they are meant to be broad) but make no
attempt to place the descriptive data in such taxonomy. Electronic
descriptive pages vary widely, but those that embed taxonomy in their
databases risk errors, excessive and often redundant data, and
fragility in the face of taxonomic revisions.

I say that if we are talking about descriptive data, we should just
stick to descriptive data.

The full taxonomic hierarchy of the included taxa/items certainly must be
supported by the standard (and it will be addressed after we deal with
simple characters, states and items).  If the creator of the dataset doesn't
think it's important then they can choose to leave it out; if the user of
the data doesn't think it's important then they can ignore it.  This will be
especially important if we intend to support inheritance and compilation up
and down the classification (as has been suggested by several of us).

Jumping the gun a bit, I would think these relationships would be stored
either as a separate nested set of elements with ID's linking to specific
items, or the items themselves would be nested with parent items containing
their children.

On the taxonomic heirarchy thread - I agree wholeheartedly that the
heirarchy should not be part of the description. Could it rather be a
recommended link to a classification?

We often come across the situation where one person has a diferent view of
the hierarchy to another. If the heirarchy is not part of the descriptive
data but can be refered to from an alternative source then would it be
possible to use one (or another) source depending on your point of view.
That way you could follow say the ITIS calssification if it suits or if the
framework is published any other hierarchy that supports the framework
interface.

Surely there will be other hierarchies than classical taxonomy through
which providers wish to offer inheritance. Phylogenetic hierarchies
come to mind, for example. If the problem is
inheritance, then the standard should provide for that, not for a
special case. Success would be measured by the ability of the
inheritance mechanisms to provide for the special cases.

If a dataset includes the descriptions of two families and 4 genera but
doesn't tell you which genera belong to which family you will be forced to
get this information from someplace else (e.g. ITIS).  If the dataset is
based on a different arrangement from ITIS you don't know this because the
dataset didn't tell you because it's not part of the standard. In this case
the data won't make sense because the family descriptions need to be a
superset of the genera which belong to them.  I think this is a pretty basic
problem if we want to support hierarchical data (taxa at different taxonomic
ranks).

Again, if you don't want to follow the author of the dataset then you are
free to ignore the suggested classification - but I would strongly suggest
that you better know what the author is thinking and ignore all of her data
if you don't agree with it, not accept the descriptions while rejecting the
classification.

I am not sure I follow here but I do agree it is definately wise to
understand the thoughts of a taxononomist <grin>...

I am not an expert in this area by any means but it it would seem to me that
whether you choose to accept or reject someones description and whether you
want to accept their taxonomic classification are two different things
(albeit closely related). Could it be that they should be modelled
seperately? That way it is possble to store a description without having to
adopt the classification structure in the data. Or is it that these two
concepts are just so tightly coupled that it is not needed?

Just a thought... not of a taxonomist

Cheers

We may not be arguing here. I don't dispute the need for this, only
argue that there should not be a standard for taxonomy, but rather a
standard for how to specify taxonomy. Or any other hierarchy for that
matter.

Doing this would allow you to get the hiearchy from /any/ suitable
source, including but not limited to the data source itself. To me it
seems that the least brittle thing for data inheritance is to use the
same model as for datatype inheritance, i.e. a separate "schema" to
which reference is made, as Tim Jones argued.

Sounds fine, store the hierarchy but keep it separate from the items.  No
worries.  The idea of supporting multiple hierarchies for different
inheritances is interesting and I can see its potential importance.  I'll
need to test it out here in "biology land" to see if it makes sense in
practice.

I believe that the classification is tied very closely to taxon concepts,
and that descriptions are certainly tied to concepts. If you change the
concept you almost always change the description, and so knowing the
classification can be important in understanding what the author is up to.

This raises the old argument for scoring _data_ in our databases rather
than information derived from those data. This is to say that your
system should at least allow of scoring descriptive data at specimen
level rather than at the conceptual level of species (or other taxa).
Thus the descriptions of taxa could be derived "just in time", ie on the
fly when required. Redetermination of a given suite of specimens would
result in all the relevant descriptions, keys, and other products being,
in effect, dynamic. This will be vital for projects which are
institutional or international in scope.

Taxonomic disagreements aside, I have run into programming "gotchas"
in the past because I did not know about generic homonyms and thus
my code was ignorant of homonyms.  I was surprised then to find both
a corticioid fungus and a marine sponge with the same genus name
(Corticium is in both Carticiaceae and Plakinidae).  Also a surprise
to find both a fungus and a plant with the same genus name (Virgaria).
Then a taxonomic guru told me about the genus Erica for insects/plants.
There are probably two dozen others...

<bold>I think that if databases are to be anything other than local,
this seems to be the issue</bold>.  One can in theory at least go from
measurement to shape terms and still keep the basic data intact.  At
the risk of overkill, below are some important (I think) points to be
borne in mind.  Note that these measurements and images I talkk about
(sorry, this is edited from some notes which may turn into a paper or a
lecture for next term's class) are really the metadata that ground the
data of the description of an animal or plant or the character states
of a phylogenetic analysis.  Although the comments below are couched in
terms of phylogenetic analysis, the metadata assembled would be useful
for a variety of purposes.


<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger><bigger>Access to
individual observations linked to individual specimens is the ideal
towards which we should strive.  Photographs, drawings, images in
general and measurements as well as bibliographic references are the
proper metadata of morphological-phylogenetic data; they ground those
data.

Having such metadata readily accessible has several advantages.

1.  We should be able to revisit earlier decisions that there were
states by examining the observations available to the authors who made
those decisions.

2.  The same character may be quite properly divided in different ways
for different taxa within a larger group.  When studying the larger
group, we need to combine all the raw data from which the states were
separately abstracted in the smaller studies.  Combining raw data may
destroy states, looking at a subset of the raw data may suggest
additional states.

3. There is no knowing how future morphological observations will
relate to a gap that currently separates two states (this is unlike the
normal situation for molecular data).  Similarly, data based on
misidentified specimens or taxa assigned to the wrong higher taxon
should be in a form that allows them to be easily placed in their
correct contexts, at the same time evaluating any effects this may have
on state delimitation.

4. Gap coding is not universally accepted, and there are at present no
sound reasons for preferring one method of coding over another.  There
are few studies that code the same variation in different ways and
compare the results.  Absent such reasons, studies and comparisons,
metadata will enable observations to be used by a variety of coding
practices.

5. If the states scored for a taxon are those believed to be basal in
it (Nandi et al. 1998; Doyle and Endress 2000), details of the
variation within the taxon need to be accessible.  This is particularly
necessary given that our knowledge of taxa presumed to be "basal" in a
lineage and so sometimes (but largely incorrectly) emphasized when
assigning states is in a state of flux.


The general direction we should go is clear.  Genbank is more reliable
than Vernon Heywood's shoebox in which we often place our data
(Heywood, 19).  The shoebox may be discarded when we move, and our
heirs and assignees may well consign it to the recycling pile or
bonfire on our deaths.  Unless our observations can be stored
somewhere, phylogenetic hypotheses will not cumulate.  Information on
each character should be stored as individual measurements and images
as far as is possible, and linked to specimens and place of
publication.  If we are serious about morphology, we need an equivalent
to GenBank, a MorphBank.

        Attached is an attempt at a usuable DTD for taxonomic descriptions.
It is modified from a Taxonomic Document Markup based largely on DELTA
format data.  I modified the original based on the mailing list
contributions of Steve Shattuck, L. Dodds, and G. Rousse.

        The most visible difference is use of attributes to hold information
without real-world meaning.  This is based on current modelling techniques
and is explained by Rouse in his posting of Nov. 23 much more clearly than I
could explain it.  There are also many attributes derived from the DELTA
format which may not be applicable.

        I would like to omit the attribute for order from the standard.  If
each taxon/specimen, character, and state is uniquely identified, then
ordering is more flexibly handled in XSL.  This would allow those who want
to order based on alphabet, a character state (as in field guides), inferred
relationships, etc. to do as they please without changing the data.  Because
of the nature of XML, each description will be part of a higher element,
usually either a specimen or a taxon.  It is these entities that are
ordered, not the descriptions themselves.  Within a description, the
ordering and selection of characters is easiest with XSL or other
processing.  This allow the author (or compiler) of the document to arrange
characters in a way that makes sense for the treatment.

        The summary outline is also included in the DTD.

        For those still looking for XML/XSL tools, I recommend XML Cooktop
for Windows  http://www.xmleverywhere.com as a good general editor, it
handles DTD's and Schema' as text files for editing, but otherwise is good
and the XSL editing and testing is excellent.

        I apologize for using DTDs instead of Schemas.  It is the language I
know and have been using for a while now.  For me, they are a little clearer
and easier to understand, even if they are not quite as flexible. If the
group wants only Schemas, I will learn that next.  There is a good utility
for converting DTDs to Schemas at
http://puvogel.informatik.med.uni-giessen.de/dtd2xs/

        In the next few days, I will send in some markup of challenge cases
and XSL routines.

One additional point to consider is that hierarchies arise not only in the
classification of items (taxa or specimens), but also in the classification
of the characters used to describe those item. And along both the item and
character "axes", there will often be multiple, alternative hierarchies
which reflect different purposes or philosophies.

For example, in assembling an interactive key to plants, one might well
want to group characters dealing with leaves separately from characters
dealing with the infloresence. And perhaps a trickier "hierarchy" of
characters is one that might be used to describe the rules for "natural
language" generation, aggregating characters into phrases, sentences and
paragraphs.

Does anyone see a good generalized mechanism for handling the creation and
maintenance of hierarchies (or other groupings)?

Here are a few thoughts off the top of my head: Because of the need for
handling alternative hierarchies for different purposes, it would seem
logical to keep the "classification" separate from the "core" data (going
back to DELTA, this was one reason why "directives" files were used - it
provided a mechanism for changing groupings without touching the core
data). But this approach comes at a significant cost: if the "core" data is
changed, it will probably require synchronized changes in the various
hierarchy descriptions which reference that data. Maintaining consistency
becomes a problem. Perhaps the way out is to make use of unique global
identifiers (GUIDs), as Steve Shattuck has suggested.

Here's another need for Use Cases. Oops. I mean data challenges.
I suspect it is not profitable to approach this problem without
detailed examples. Those examples might illuminate whether the
problems of hierarchy rearangement can simply be handled by XSLT, as
probably can the examples you give.

| Below and attached are a first attempt at representing simple, common
| DELTA-type data in an XML-based structure.  I've used a selected set of
| characters and items from the Butterfly sample data on the DELTA web site.
| The DELTA-formatted data looks like this:
|
|
| ==== DELTA-Standard CHARS File ====
|
| *SHOW: Lepidoptera demonstration characters. Revised 28-AUG-91.
|
| *CHARACTER LIST
|
| #1. main colour of inner part of front wing/
|        1. white/
|        2. cream/
|        3. grey/
|        4. brown/
|        5. black/
|        6. yellow/
|        7. orange/
|        8. blue/
|        9. green/
|
| #2. wings <transparency>/
|        1. with transparent areas/
|        2. without transparent areas/
|
| #3. length of front wing/
|        mm/
|
| #4. antennae <length>/
|        times length of front wing/
|
|
| ==== DELTA-Standard ITEMS File ====
|
| *SHOW: Lepidoptera demonstration items. Revised 18-OCT-94.
|
| *ITEM DESCRIPTIONS
|
| # Antheraea/
| 1,4 2,2 3,43-50 4,0.15-0.2
|
| # Ethmia/
| 1,2-4 2,2 3,11-14 4,0.6-0.65
|
| # Graphium/
| 1,1-2/9 2,2 3,29-33 4,0.45-0.5
|
| # Hecatesia/
| 1,4 2,1<small, translucent window>/2 3,11-14 4,0.8-0.9
|
|
| ==== DELTA-Standard SPECS File ====
|
| *SHOW: Lepidoptera demonstration specifications. Revised 28-AUG-91.
|
| *NUMBER OF CHARACTERS 4
| *MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STATES 9
| *MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITEMS 4
|
| *CHARACTER TYPES 3,RN 4,RN
|
| *NUMBERS OF STATES 1,9
|
|
|
|
| ==== For these files, the DELTA-generated natural language would look
| something like this:
|
| Antheraea
| Main colour of inner part of front wing brown. Wings without transparent
| areas. Length of front wing 43-50 mm. Antennae 0.15-0.2 times length of
| front wing.
|
| Ethmia
| Main colour of inner part of front wing cream to brown. Wings without
| transparent areas. Length of front wing 11-14 mm. Antennae 0.6-0.65 times
| length of front wing.
|
| Graphium
| Main colour of inner part of front wing white to cream, or green. Wings
| without transparent areas. Length of front wing 29-33 mm. Antennae
0.45-0.5
| times length of front wing.
|
| Hecatesia
| Main colour of inner part of front wing brown. Wings with transparent
areas
| (small, translucent window), or without
| transparent areas. Length of front wing 11-14 mm. Antennae 0.8-0.9 times
| length of front wing.
|
|
|
|
| ==== Hand-generated natural language would be essentially the same except
| for the last item, where it might look more like this:
|
| Hecatesia
| Main colour of inner part of front wing brown. Wings with or without
| transparent areas (when present, forming a small window). Length of front
| wing 11-14 mm. Antennae 0.8-0.9 times length of front wing.

| ============================================
|
| I've translated this into the XML file that is attached.  (Even this
fairly
| simple example is moderately large and I would recommend using an XML
viewer
| such as Microsoft's XML Notepad when working with it - see
|
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnxml/html/
| xmlpaddownload.asp.)
|
| The basic structure of the attached file is:
|
| <Morphology>
|    <Characters>
|       <Character> - ANY NUMBER
|          <Type>
|          <ID>
|          <Short_Descriptor>
|          <Long_Descriptor>
|          <State_Descriptor>
|          <Order>
|          <State> - ANY NUMBER
|             <Value>
|             <ID>
|             <Order>
|    <Items>
|       <Item> - ANY NUMBER
|          <Type>
|          <ID>
|          <Descriptor>
|          <CodedCharacter> - ANY NUMBER
|             <CharacterID>
|             <Description>
|             <CodedState> - ANY NUMBER
|                <StateID>
|                <Value>
|
|
| Note that I've treated everything as elements and haven't used attributes.
| Simplicity is the only reason for this and some elements would be better
as
| attributes; these can be converted when the dust settles.
|
| I've tried to generalise as much as possible and use only two main
elements:
| <character> and <item>.  Each character is assigned a <type> that tells
what
| it is (ordered multistate, unordered multistate, real, integer, etc).
| Similarly the item <type> can be specified as taxon or specimen (or
| potentially something else).
|
| A couple of points are probably worth making:
|
| The <Short_Descriptor> and <Long_Descriptor> are used to support DELTA
| comments.  This probably needs to be generalised further to support any
| number of alternate phrasings.
|
| <State_Descriptor> is used for the units of numeric characters and isn't
| needed (?) for other character types - it's an attempt at keeping
| <character> general.
|
| The <Description> element in <CodedCharacter> is used to house natural
| language representations. Codes for the states (when needed) are placed in
| square brackets, these being translated during generation.  As noted
above,
| this may been to be generalised to support any number of phrasings.
|
| In <CodedState>, <Value> is used to hold numeric values, the <character>
| <state> being used to define what the number means (minimum, maximum,
etc.,
| rather than using placement in the attribute string as in the DELTA
| standard).  This element won't (?) be needed for multistate characters.
|
| I think/hope the remainder is fairly clear.
|
|
| ** The Next Step **
|
| I would suggest the following path from here:
|
| 1) Make sure the above representation makes sense for the data given.
|
| 2) Expand the above data to support LucID-specific requirements (without
| adding additional complexity).
|
| Once this is finished we can:
|
| Add additional DELTA features (dependencies, default values, etc.)
|
| Add more complex data sets and examples
|
| Add new features on our assorted "wish lists"
|
|
| I look forward to comments and forward progress!

Here's my first go at representing Challenge 1.

The challenge:

Rigid, spreading shrub to c. 1m high and wide; stems glabrous. Leaves soon
deciduous (particularly on older plants), +/- oblong, (4-)6-10(-15) mm long,
2-3 mm wide, apex obtuse or minutely mucronate within an apical notch,
glabrous or a few hairs present near tip; stipules dark reddish-brown, c. 1
mm long, often shallowly joined around the node; spines stout, 1.5-4 cm
long.

Discaria nitida

Slender shrub, to 5 m high; stems glabrous. Leaves persistent (rarely
deciduous), elliptic to obovate, (8-)10-20(-30) mm long, 3-7 mm wide,
glabrous, shining; spines not developed at each node, to c. 1 cm long.

Issues

I've taken the route of marking up a textual description, using a minimum of
tags. It seems to me that a description comprises a series of features with
values. I've used mixed markup because I wanted to have the mimimum tagging
and make maximum use of the text. That is, in cases like:

<Feature Name="Life form"><Value>shrub</Value></Feature>

I've made use of the fact that "shrub" occurs in the text by enclosing it in
<Value> tags. In cases like:

<Feature><Name>Leaves</Name>

I'm using a <Name> tag rather than a Name attribute

This may make processing considerably more difficult, but it seems to me
that there are some advantages. An alternative would be to first process the
description into a DELTA-like structure then mark up that. I chose not to go
that route because I still have the dream that one day we'll have a method
of semi-automatically marking up the content of natural language into
something like the above. The other advantage of this structure I believe is
that it maintains all the complexity and nuance of the original natural
language (which can be retrieved merely by removing all the tags). I prefer
this to the DELTA-process (take a natural-language description -> atomise
it -> reconstruct semi-natural-language by putting the atoms back together
again in some fashion).

Features are nested:

<Feature><Name>Leaves</Name>
 <Feature><Name>Shape</Name></Feature>
</Feature>

Is this allowable? In XML-Spy I can create a Schema OK for this document.
It's also well-formed.

In this example, there is not a 1:1 correspondence between the
descriptions - e.g. the description for D. pubescens has

<Feature Name="Apex shape">

while that for D. nitida does not. This is anathema to most of us, but is a
real world case. We'll have to deal with it.

In this example there is no character list against which character names etc
can be validated (to e.g. pick up the above problem). This is something we
need to deal with.

Be gentle with me.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to show that I'm crazy and
do better than this.

Can I propose that we note but set aside the Taxonomic Hierarchy thread for
the moment. In the challenge cases, Challenge 7 will begin to address this
issue (in this challenge we will attempt to represent descriptions from a
nested set of descriptions e.g. family (genus (species (specimens)))). When
this comes up, we will need to address both hierarchy as a way of handling
inheritance, and also alternate hierarchies (differing taxonomic opinions).
But surely we need to work out how to represent a single description before
we tackle a nested set.

Concerning Steve's exemplar drawn from a DELTA butterfly treatment: I've
added a few challenges to the challenge cases (number 9 in the attached)
specifically designed to address representation of DELTA datasets in the new
standard. Personally, I don't think we should start with a DELTA data set as
our first challenge, for several reasons:

1. We have agreed several times that it's important not to be canalized by
DELTA or any other existing representation, but to keep the existing
representations in mind while working. Starting with XDELTA seems to me to
increase the risk of canalization
2. Of all the descriptions in the world, 99.9999999% of them are not in
DELTA. Probably 99.999% of them are textual (natural language) descriptions.
Surely this should form the basis of our first challenge, methinks.
3. Related to 2 above, many (though by no means all) DELTA datasets are
already abstractions from the source (a set of natural language
descriptions). We should start with the source.

This time I've attached the attachment. Sometime soon we'll put this up on
the web instead of flying it around as an attachment.

'Free' in free software refers to freedom, not price (think free speech, not
free beer). XML Notepad is freeware (currently), not free software. I think
distinction here is really important.

And about the utility of a dedicated xml editor vs a text editor, it is
defenitively a question of personal taste. It all depends of the editor, the
ease you have with it, etc... As a die-hard vim-user, i never found any
specialized xml editor which allowed so many functionalities.

        Attached are the files for a partial solution to the first Challenge
case.  I have deliberately left out the XSLT code that capitalizes the first
letter in a sentence and eliminates the comma before the period.  The stuff
I have written is awkward and embarassing and I will try to come up with a
more elegant way that can be used for general formatting of the nodes.

        This DTD corrects some of the typos in the DTD posted yesterday.
The XML file should validate against this DTD.  I commented out the DOCTYPE
line in the XML because the Xalan parser is fussy about how the file
location is cited and I wanted one file to test with all the parsers.

        The XSLT code runs correctly using Microsoft, Sablotron, Saxon, and
Xalan parsers in XMLCooktop.  The resulting html file is also attached.  I
had to do this because the code does not run properly under MS Internet
Explorer 5.5.  This could be a namespace problem.  I will look into it.

        Unfortunately, I did this coding before I saw Kevin Thiele's Nov 27
posting.  That posting contains some good ideas about markup that I want to
incorporate in this DTD.  I especially like his handling of 'shrub' as a
character state, not a name.  Like Kevin, I nest characters. There are many
small differences in the two approaches.  The most notable is the handling
of numeric characters and ranges. My approach may be too simple for anything
but natural language output.

        As a side challenge, I would like to try to develop code that would
produce a tabular description from this markup. The table should have blank
cells for missing data. This will help determine if it is necessary to code
missing characters as part of the description, or if we can get by with only
coding the character we know. I think the later approach is most practical.
This will also help determine if nested characters can be  used.

While canalization is a risk, there certainly is also merit in trying to
retain the best features of "prior art". The DELTA format has persisted for
over 20 years, which is nearly an eternity in the IT field. It must have
been doing one or two things right. There's no need to follow it too
closely, but certainly we can learn quite a bit from DELTA about what works
well and what doesn't.

I think that's actually a rather harsh assessment of DELTA's uptake. Let's
say there are about 4x10^6 known species. We'd like descriptions for them
all, along with descriptions of higher taxonomic levels (genera, families).
So the magnitude of total number of descriptions is about 10^7. I'd guess
that the number of taxa with DELTA descriptions is of the magnitude of
10^5. So that means roughly 1% of all taxa already have a DELTA description.

The source? Surely the ultimate source is observations made on individual
specimens. If we wish to start with the source, the first thing that needs
to be done is to make sure that we have a system which can adequately
describe a specimen in hand.

(Sorry if I get too defensive about DELTA. I just can't help myself...)

My position on this is rather different, and I would prefer to see
characters defined a bit more rigorously.

As an example, suppose that the description of one taxon is given as:

   <Feature Name="Life form"><Value>shrub</Value></Feature>

A second as:

   <Feature Name="Life form"><Value>bush</Value></Feature>

And a third as:

   <Feature Name="Life form"><Value>small woody plant</Value></Feature>

And perhaps a fourth as:

   <Feature Name="Growth form"><Value>shrub</Value></Feature>

Are these equivalent? There's certainly no obvious way to associate them,
aside from knowing that "bush" and "shrub" mean pretty much the same thing
in some dialects of English. I think the goal of trying to extract meaning
by inserting a few tags into existing textual descriptions relies too
heavily on a level of artificial intelligence that we're still unlikely to
see for a couple of decades.

But pondering on this made me think about why Kevin and I often disagree on
some of these issues. If I may greatly over-simplify our viewpoints, his
view is (I think) that a formal description ought to be a document from
which data can be extracted; whereas I tend of view a formal description
more as a database from which text can be generated.

So what ARE we after: the free-flowing flexibility of a document, or the
rigour and precision of a database? Fortunately, there is a fair bit of
middle ground. It's worth noting that XML was developed as a markup
language for documents, but that it's primary usage to date has been as a
sort of portable and relatively light-weight data container. Still I think
that finding the right balance between flexibility and rigour is going to
be a major challenge in this exercise.

It's certainly allowable in XML. Is it desirable in a description?
Possibly, but I think it relates to my question from yesterday about
hierarchies of characters ought to be expressed. Nesting is a very good way
to express a single hierarchy, but not for handling alternative
hierarchies. Which do people want?

No-one has suggested ignoring prior art, be it DELTA or any of the other

works and what doesn't along the way.

I didn't stop to consider the maths, for which my apologies. My point was
simply that a vast minority of decriptions are in any type of standardised
format at the present. If your estimations are correct (and I can't judge
that) then there are still 99 non-DELTA descriptions for every DELTA one, or
any other.

Yes, you're right about the ultimate source, but there are chains of
sources, of course. The reason why I'm interested in the vast legacy of
textual descriptions as source material is that I think that effective
semi-automated processing of these descriptions along the lines of Pankhurst
and Taylor is not too far off (some processing is here already, if course).
We should make this easier rather than harder, if at all possible. Capturing
the truly ultimate direct observations is something that any Builder program
supporting the new standard will have to be good at, of course.

Please don't think that I'm too dismissive of DELTA. I just think we should
be assuming that we can do a fair bit better.

Good point, and there will clearly be a need for some type of processing
somewhere along the line to catch and allow validation of these situations.
But this is a processing issue, not a structural one. There's nothing in the
DELTA data structure to prevent

#1. Life form/
    1. shrub/
    2. bush/
    3. small woody plant/

#2. Growth form/
    1. shrub/
    2. smallish twiggy plant/

and I argue there should be nothing in the structure of the SDD standard to
prevent it either. People simply need to be aware of the issue. But the SDD
does, I agree, need to be structured in such a way that validation of these
situations is made possible. The first-cut structure that I proposed does
not allow much eyeball validation of this type - is this a problem?

My view I suppose is that part of the power of XML (something that has never
been possible in the past) is that it allows precise retrieval of atomised
data from a fairly free-form document. XML blurs the distinction between
database and text. Before XML a text string like:

Rigid, spreading shrub to c. 1m high and wide; stems glabrous. Leaves soon
deciduous.....

was highly intractable to computer processing. This intractability required
us to manually and substantially restructure into e.g. a DELTA file before
we could really do much with it. But there are problems I think with the
DELTA process vis-a-vis natural language. In the relatively common case that
we begin with a natural language description, the process is:

natural language ----(1)-----> DELTA -------(2)-------->natural language
(etc)

where (1) is human processing and (2) is largely computer (CONFOR)
processing. Two related problems here. Firstly, I often don't much like the
output of CONFOR (some people say we humans should put up with the
limitations computers force on us, but call me old-fashioned , I rebel at
that {see also Asimov's Second Law of Robotics}). The second problem is that
step 2 is unidirectional - if I edit the output natural language I break the
process (the edits are volatile, next time I invoke CONFOR they get
overwritten).

So I'm trying to explore the new possibilities opened up by XML to produce a
minimally restructured but highly parsable document.

I'm happy to admit that I may be off-beam here. I just reckon we shouldn't
discount the possibility.

        <ovate>
        <elliptic>
<Flowers>
    <colour>
        <blue>

I can't decide if this a trivial or fundamental difference.

In DELTA, Lucid etc we express alternate hierarchies in alternate documents.
Do we need to do better than this?

I have been watching the animated discussion on the revived SDD list and
it is tood to see... too busy to comment, but still interested, and
useful things are being said by others...  :)

Is that really two levels of character is is it only one with a state
attribure?

Also, in our new model we also want to show more than just presence
or absence of a state.  Don't we want to show if it is present/rarely
present/present by misinterpretation/rarely present by
misisnterpretation, etc., and my favourites yet to be implemented as
a character stae attribute: definitely absent, absent by
misinterpretation, unknown, unscored

That is where we want to get to do, but echoing Bob's words, what we
are after is the structure that allows us to get to that, giving
people all the appearance of freedom to do what they like but not
actually doing it and imposing a schematic straight jacket on the data.
A schema for the data structure rather than the descriptive data itself.
Like all freedoms, the descriptive data one too must be an illusion or
we wil miss out on on all the creative potential that it offers as the
free spirits among us do theri own thing.  But that is another
discussion...  :)

There has been a lot of talk about the feature/value paradigm and how
this might be made to represent a biological description and even nested
features in such descriptions...

At the recent TDWG meeting Richard Pankhurst described something like a
feature/character/value paradigm and at the time I made a note that this
was probalably worth considering in more detail, but so far have not had
the time.

It probably would mean something like:

<feature name="leaf" charecter="margin" value="serrate"/> or some
equivalent using XML entities rather than attributes.

Is there any merit in this approach above using a feature that is say
"leaf margin" and another that is say "leaf tip"  and yet another that
is say "leaf base"? It would seem to give some structure to the character
set data.

On the surface it would also allow easy generation of more readable
descriptions without excessive text processing:

Leaf outline ovate, margin serrate, tip acute, base attenuate, etc.

        as opposed to:

Leaf outline ovate, leaf margin serrate, leaf tip acute, leaf base
attenuate,  leaf... etc.

Has anyone else considered this approach?

Let's stop this line of thought right now...

build one hierachy of characters that works first, THEN consider how to
manage alternatives...

Is this a real issue or one of semantics?  When I write "leaf shape
ovate", does it mean I have observed the leaf and its shape most closely
matches that of ovate, or that I have observed the shape character leaf
and consider it to be in a state of ovateness?

The end result is probably the same...

But I think the issue is worth pondering... Perhaps Richard did not have
it quite right and perhaps we should be recording zero or more
observations which are made of a feature that has a certain character
one of the attributes (rather than the state) of which is present/
absent/misinterpreted, etc.  Maybe something like:

<observation sequence="3" basis="specimen" refereence="Stevens in NGF67432">
  <feature name="leaf">
    <character name="margin" value="serrate" state="present"/>
  </feature>
</observation>
<observation sequence="4" basis="literature" reference="Stevens 1998a">
etc...

or maybe it would be better to invert it and define a feature up front
and make one or more observations about it:

<feature name="leaf">
  <character name="margin">
    <observation value="serrate" modification="obscurely" state="present"
     basis="specimen" reference="Stevens in NGF67432"/>
    <observation ..... />
    <observation ..... />
  </character>
</feature>

There are numberous ways to moddel this sort of stuff, and has been
repeatedly pointed out there is no right way to do it, there are only
ways.  The challenge is to find one that is functional, comprehensive,
flexible, extensible, pragmatic and elegant.  And one that we can all
agree on...

> Probably getting old.

as are we all...  and we have to get this damn thing working before
our use-by dates are up...  :)

The other qualifiers (misinterps etc) aren't in there yet, but will come.

 <Feature name = "Leaves">
    <Feature name = "shape">

But I can't see that "margin" is a thing different in kind from "leaf".
Sure, the margin is part of a leaf but equally the leaf is part of the
plant, so if you have feature|character|value then you will end up with
"leaf" as a feature in one context and a character in another - messy,
surely. My example above just has Feature|value. The difference is that a
feature is a thing but a value is not (both "leaf" and "margin" are things
that can be pointed at, "ovate" and "blue" are not). In the XML tree
representation above features are nodes and values are twigs (or leaves if
you like - of course, a "twig" would be a node, not a twig (or a leaf) - oh
dear, can someone invent a language that isn't a language!)

Ditto for Jim's second example:

|<feature name="leaf">
|  <character name="margin">
|    <observation value="serrate" modification="obscurely" state="present"
|     basis="specimen" reference="Stevens in NGF67432"/>
|    <observation ..... />
|    <observation ..... />
|  </character>
|</feature>

Try interpolating another level in here (e.g. marginal teeth shape) and you
get into strife. Whereas with

<feature name="leaf">
  <feature name="margin">
    <value value="serrate" modification="obscurely" state="present"
     basis="specimen" reference="Stevens in NGF67432"/>
    <observation ..... />
    <observation ..... />
  </feature>
</feature>

We can surely add as many levels as we like.

Or can we - here's a challenge - find the simplest way of expanding
description 1: "Leaf margin serrate" into description 2: "Leaf margin
serrate with forward-pointing teeth".

Attempt 1.
"Leaf margin serrate"
<feature name="leaf">
  <feature name="margin">
     <value>serrate</value>
  </feature>
</feature>

"Leaf margins serrate with forward-pointing teeth"
<feature name="leaf">
  <feature name="margin">
    <feature name = "teething shape">
        <value>serrate</value>
    </feature>
    <feature name = "teeth orientation">with
        <value>forward-pointing</value>teeth
    </feature>
  </feature>
</feature>

This requires moving <value="serrate"/> from the node <feature
name="margin"> to a new interpolated node <feature name = "teething shape">,
so as to keep a rule that <value>s cannot have <feature>s as siblings. An
alternative:

Attempt 2.

"Leaf margins serrate with forward-pointing teeth"
<feature name="leaf">
  <feature name="margin">
    <value>serrate</value>
    <feature name = "teeth orientation">
        <value>forward-pointing</value>
    </feature>
  </feature>
</feature>

breaks this rule. Attempt 2 seems preferable to me in terms of efficiency,
but the rule seems somehow important.

Of course, restricting ourselves to a 2-level heirarchy a la Lucid and DELTA
makes these problems go away, but only because we artificially collapse the
levels down and lose the structure:

"Leaf margins serrate with forward-pointing teeth"
<feature name="leaf margin teething">
    <value>serrate</value>
</feature>
<feature name = "leaf margin teeth orientation">
        <value>forward-pointing</value>
</feature>

I'm getting lost here - can someone help?  We've +/- discussed this before,
but we need more thinking around real examples such as these.

Subject:      Thought and a Question
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'll start with the question:

Am I right in assuming that the process is to propose and agree on a
set of challenges, and then present different solutions for solving
these?

If so, how should those solutions be presented. Kevin and Kerry
have both posted XML documents that meet Challenge 1, and
and Steve Shattuck and I have also provided XML formats that
can encode similar data.

How will we judge these formats as better or worse? I can imagine
producing a near infinite number of different XML vocabularies
that can encode the same data (+/- attributes, different tag
names, nesting, cross-referencing, etc, etc).

I'd like to suggest, again, that the solutions for the challenges
should be presented as simple data models. Syntax can come later
(and may fall naturally out of the model).

--

Now the thought:

Kevin has pointed out that there is a large amount of taxonomic
data which is simply free text, and it is a worthwhile goal to
consider how to repurpose this information.

However, I think that that is a separate work item to defining
a format for capturing that data.

I'd actually interpeted Challenge 1 to mean "represent the data contained
in these natural language descriptions", and was ignoring (for the
present) how that data would be extracted (manual markup of
the text description or direct data entry into a suitable tool).

Extracting information from free text is still far from being
an automated process. If there is still going to be a manual element
involved for some time, it seems better to have a standard and
supporting tools to capture _new_ data in a rigorous format, while
considering the markup and processing of 'legacy' data as a separate
issue.

To approach this slightly differently, the example markup that Kevin
has suggested adding to free text descriptions would be interpreted
according to a standard data model :)

--

I hope this isn't interpreted as an attempt to derail the good progress
being made (nice to see some discussion again! :) but in the 'XML world'
we're seeing problems surface because of incompatibilities between
specifications that have arisen due to slightly different interpretations
of the XML data model. This is because the model came after the
syntax.

DON'T REPLY TO THE LIST:

As I mentioned in Sydney, we have now established an instance of the
vBulletin web-based forum software (see www.vbulletin.com) and are prepared to
host a forum here for the current discussions if there is any desire
to do so.

Forums provide better threading than email (it is not based solely on
the Subject field) and also permit participants to consider things
somwhat more at their own schedule and according to their own
interests. The board administrators can set how long postings remain
at the forefront, so that it is easier to understand what is
current. vBulletin allows you to be notified briefly by mail when
something of interest appeared on the forum.

There are a few disadvantages to moving this discussion now: (a)Quite
a bit has transpired and people might feel they need to restate things
in the forum [that could be an advantage....]; (b)we are new to this
software and might not administer it as seamlessly as a mail-based
system.

So as not to clutter  the list. I would urge
people to /privately/ reply to me with their sympathy for or against
the issue. I'll summarize and post the results and then people can
discuss it, if warranted. Send mail to ram@cs.umb.edu. Your "Reply"
facility will likely send to the list.


For a glimpse of how vBulletin forums operate, see those at

As far as I can tell, vBulletin is the software under the forum parts
of sourceforge.net



Bob Morris

p.s.

Forum software is aimed at community building, so vBuilder has lots of
flashy features like smiley face annotations, personal avatars, polls
about the quality of a thread, "buddy lists", etc. I don't expect that
SDD forums would operate with that stuff in your face, especially as
we gain administrative experience.

Thoughts on Leigh's Question

At this stage, I am not worried about the differences in the XML
vocabularies used by different people.  For at least a little while we
should explore the alternatives and see what the different models and
different encodings have to offer.  I have found that other peoples work has
really helped me to see better solutions to some of the problems and
sometimes helped me think of new ideas to try.

I think that after a while, the alternatives will become set and the group
will need to have a means of selecting among the alternatives.  The
challenge cases should provide a way to evaluate the effectiveness of the
different solutions.  Then the group can come up with a proposal, invite
comments, and work out the first version.

How to present the different solutions to the challenge cases is a problem
that should be worked out now.  If this was decided at the last meeting, let
us know.  Otherwise, it seems that many people have there own ideas of the
proper way to present solutions.

My ideas are:

        An XML data model is, for me, a DTD or a Schema.  The model is an
abstract representation of the data.  This is what we should be producing.
        Personally, I prefer DTD's because I am more familiar with them.
They are easier to understand because they are simple and relatively free of
markup.  As Bob Morris has pointed out though, they do lack some of the
features found in XML Schemas.  However, Schemas are more difficult to
understand, especially for people who might know the systematics, but not
the XML.

        A solution to a challenge case should have the model (DTD or
Schema), markup of the challenge case that validates to the model, and a
short program that solves the challenge using the markup.  The last is
important because it is too easy to develop a theoretically neat model that
has practical problems.  Also, if the group is to pick from the features of
different alternatives it would be better to see how they work.

These are just my thoughts and I would like to understand what others are
thinking and what may have already been decided at the last meeting.

If the group can keep up the current level of activity, a forum would be a
great idea.  They are really a much more flexible way to work together.

Very droll... However, Greg and I have discussed this in depth over a
bottle of red and have come to the firm conclusion that without the
attribute of "often misinterpreted as definitely known to be unknown", and
the corresponding "rarely misinterpreted as definitely known to be
unknown", accurate representation of author intent in biological
descriptions will never be possible...

So get to it - we expect to see this in the next software release, real
soon now...

Although XML allows mixed content such as Kevin's:
<Feature><Name>spines</Name>, not developing at each node,
<Feature Name="Length" MinValue="0">to c.
<MaxValue>1</MaxValue><Units>cm</Units> long</Feature>
</Feature>
and such a document can be validated against a schema, apart from being
untidy and inelegant, mixed content can pose certain problems when
attempted to be loaded into a relational database; this is probably not
going to impress people like Gregor.

Can we agree that although mixed content XML is quite allowable, we are
going to try and avoid it in the SDD context?

Hey, who said we should aim to make life easier for Gregor? I regard it as a
life ambition to make things harder for software developers, especially
those who insist on cramming mother nature kicking and screaming into a
database!

The mixed content of my suggestion is the thing I worry about most. But if
there are advantages to mixed content (and it seems to me there are) then I
think these should be weighed against the difficulty of dealing with it.
Once we have more alternate solutions to challenge 1 we can deal with the
advantages/disadvantages of particular solutions. I wouldn't like to
preclude mixed content at this early stage - let's knock it on the head a
bit further down the track.

Cheers - k

I don't believe that minimizing markup is a desirable design goal. The
usual argument for it is that it makes the document easier for humans to read,
but the plain fact is that XML is rarely written or read by humans
except when they are either debugging or designing. If there really
are no natural tags to surround text in a particular case, it is
common to just surround it with <text> </text>.

In this case, as is common, the tension arising is that between
articulating object structure and articulating document structure. As
I now understand DELTA, it devotes quite a bit of energy to ease of
producing documents, and maybe this group has to soon decide
whether ease (as opposed to possibility) of producing documents is a
more important design goal than ease of describing structures suitable
for searching, integration with other structures such as those
emerging from the Accessions groups efforts for specimen records,
molecular data, and other data from sources other than those in a
descriptive database. Resolving this tension with a compromise could
make /both/ enterprises hard instead of just one. My own bias, and I
think that of XML, is that it is easier to compute documents
given rigorous structure than the other way round.

I am not yet convinced there are real advantages in mixed content, other
than allowing the reproduction of a block of text closer to what was
actually written in a prior publication.

If the information can be represented structurally without resorting to
mixed content then I think this is what we should do.  However, it might be
ok to defer banning mixed content outright until we are convinced we have a
structure that caters for all our needs.

My gut feeling is that the structure will not fully cater for our needs as
long as there is mixed content.  But we shall see...

I don't think that DELTA has given up too soon to "decide
whether ease (as opposed to possibility) of producing documents is a
more important design goal than ease of describing structures suitable
for searching, integration with other structures such as those
emerging from the Accessions groups efforts for specimen records,

descriptive database".

When starting with a database you often don't know, what is needed to suit
best the demands.  Text comments are very helpful to get to the first basis
and the developer of the database has to integrate those comments later on
into well structured language that is searchable.

Certainly. I'm trying to free up some time to devote a bit more effort
to this, so I can back up my comments with some useful (hopefully!)

I've been giving Kevin's approach some thought and have the following
comments:

Kevin's original information flow model is too simplistic.  A more realistic
model would be something like:

    Text Descriptions |                         | Text Descriptions
        Phylogenetics |---> Structured Data --->| Phylogenetics
            Specimens |                         | Identification Tools
(many)

The sources are much more varied and are often group-specific.  For example,
invertebrates have very few good quality text descriptions (most are old,
are in a range of languages (English, French, German, etc), vary greatly in
style, quality, etc. etc) and the majority of invertebrates are currently
undescribed (having 80% new taxa during a revision is common).

Similarly, the outputs required vary greatly and in ways hard to predict.
While text descriptions would seem to be a common requirement, they are in
some ways "legacy" and may become less important in the future as
applications (and users) become more sophisticated.  We need to make sure we
keep this range of uses in mind at all times.

The Structured Data is the format we're talking about here.  Don't know what
that will look like yet (but see below).

I think it's important to realise that applications will be used to move
among these in almost all cases and only very rarely will people manipulate
the data directly.  It's also important to remember that XSLT is nothing
more than an application.  Some comments seem to imply that XSLT is part of
XML, but it isn't.  For example, from a BioLink perspective (and DELTA and
probably LucID) the above model will need to be extended by adding:

    Text Descriptions |                         | Text Descriptions
        Phylogenetics |---> Structured Data --->| Phylogenetics
            Specimens |         |               | Identification Tools
(many)
                                |
                                |<-- | BioLink
                                |--> | DELTA
                                     | LucID Builder

That is, applications will import Structured Data, manipulate it and spit it
out again.  Because of this I don't really think the details of the model
matter too much, more that it is rich enough to represent all data of
interest.

********

I've also been thinking about Kevin's latest example:

"Leaf margins serrate with forward-pointing teeth"
<feature name="leaf">
  <feature name="margin">
    <feature name = "teething shape">
        <value>serrate</value>
    </feature>
    <feature name = "teeth orientation">with
        <value>forward-pointing</value>teeth
    </feature>
  </feature>
</feature>

First, it seems to me that "feature" is what taxonomists call "character"
and "value" is "state".  Being a traditionalist I'll switch back to this
common terminology:

"Leaf margins serrate with forward-pointing teeth"
<character name="leaf">
  <character name="margin">
    <character name = "teething shape">
        <state>serrate</state>
    </character>
    <character name = "teeth orientation">
        <state>forward-pointing</state>
    </character>
  </character>
</character>

A couple of points:

Kevin suggests a rule "<states>s cannot have <characters>s as siblings".
But this is what DELTA calls Dependencies, it represents the state that
controls a character.  This would seem to be a good thing (and may be very
important).

Kevin's representation is too focused on text descriptions.  A more complete
representation might be:

<character name="leaf">
  <state>present</state>
  <character name="leaf margin">
    <state>serrate</state>
    <character name = "tooth orientation">
      <state>forward-pointing</state>
    </character>
  </character>
</character>


This allows us to directly extract:

leaf = present
leaf margin = serrate
tooth orientation = forward-pointing

This will be important for both identification tools and phylogenetics.
Trying to recover this information from Kevin's representation should be
possible but will require a number of assumptions be made about the data.
This representation also captures dependencies (although this is an advanced
feature we shouldn't be talking about yet).

In my original, DELTA-centric model I used a <description> tag to try and
capture the text description information separate from the <state>
information.  My thinking was that these two
requirements/approaches/viewpoints are too distinct to cram together without
falling into the same trap as the current DELTA Standard (which is a
least-common denominator approach).

The problem here is that the phrase "Leaf margins serrate with
forward-pointing teeth" concerns 3 characters (leaf, margin and teeth) and 1
implied and 2 expressed states (present, serrate and forward pointing) with
the characters being dependent (and therefore the context containing
significant information - we know that 'teeth' have something to do with
'serrate' which has something to do with 'leaf margins' - the leaves being
present because we're describing them).  There's a lot of logic involved in
parsing this.  I can't think of a simple way of representing all this
complex information without separating it at some level.  Kevin's suggestion
represents the text description and mine the underlying data, but neither
works well for the other.

Two steps forward, one step back.  Sorry about that.

Thanks, Steve

Wow, Steve, we are virtually in perfect agreement! A first!
I have one small quibble---you actually raised it yourself

For this reason, it is probably unnecessary to represent the state
`present' at all, provided the semantics could reasonably require that
a feature which is absent is never described. Is that a reasonable
requirement?

For example, in such a case to extract from the XML all taxa which
have a leaf character in their description is not any harder for
lacking <state>present</state>. In fact it is triffling bit easier.

The desire for a `present' state perhaps comes from table-based
character-by-state organization where it could be hard to distinguish
whether the character is absent from the taxon or absent from the data.
That distinction can be made moot here, perhaps.

`presence' may be the only such state though.


 >There's a lot of logic involved in

If we assume that there is a rigorous semantics to the effect that
syntactically nested characters are always logically nested (and here
we may need to return to "feature" if "character" is too dear to
overload), is there a problem with this:

<character name="leaf">
   <character name="margin">
     <character name="teeth">
        <character name = "orientation">
           <state>forward-pointing</state>
        </character>
     </character>
  </character>
</character>

To me, the main thing that this kind of model implies is the need, in
some cases, to provide a thesaurus, e.g. to provide advice that if a
character (here `margin') has a subcharacter `teeth' then it may be
described as `serrate'. Is that bad?  Or would a purely textual
description which just said "Leaf margins with forward-pointing teeth"
be deemed wrong absent the word "serrate" ?

 >Kevin's suggestion

agreed

 >but neither works well for the other.

I think natural language parsing understanding is harder than natural
language production from structure. So I think there is less work to
go from data to description than the other way around.

Nah, at most 1/2 step back. Is your middle name Zeno?

Perfect agreement with Bob?  Maybe he's starting to rub off on me!

I think this is probably true.  I can only come up with two potential
problems:

(1) In this case the state "present" is implied but this may not always be
the case when states are not specified.   For example:

<character name="distribution">
   <character name="country">
      <state>Australia</state>
  </character>
</character>

A default state of "present" doesn't make much sense for the character
"distribution".  This may not be a serious problem but we should give it
some thought.

(2) I think the bigger problem is the flip-side: if a character isn't in the
description then it must be "absent".  We can't do it this way.


>To me, the main thing that this kind of model implies is the need, in

Adding a thesaurus would add way too much work and removing "serrate" would
be too restrictive.

If true (and I think it is) then this would suggest a more DELTA-like
structure and less of a text-markup structure for the representation.

No, this is not equivalent to dependencies, although at first sight it seems
similar. It's a tree-topology rule: the rule "<states>s can have
<characters>s as siblings" allows certain topologies for the
data-representation trees that would be preluded by the rule "<states>s
cannot have <characters>s as siblings". As I said, I don't know whether the
rule's a good or necessary one or not.

Dependencies establish relationship rules between different parts of the
tree. Sometimes these rules affect parent-sibling relationships as in the
example, but sometimes not - that is, dependencies are more complex than can
be handled by a topology rule. In dependencies, there may be several
controlling states for a character, and these may or may not occur on nodes
antecedent to the node in question.

An example (from a key of mine):

the character:

Trap structures (on carnivorous plants)
 submerged or underground bladder-traps
 pitcher-traps
 sticky hairs
 irritable leaf-blade segments

has controlling states in several other characters, viz:

Nutritional strategy
 carnivorous
 parasitic*
 neither carnivorous nor parasitic*

Habit
 tree*
 shrub*
 terrestrial herb
 aquatic herb

In the key, if a user chooses a state marked * the character "Trap
Structures" will disappear because of the dependencies. Note that the
dependency on tree and shrub is not a logical one but a contextual one - it
just happens that no trees or shrubs are carnivorous, so the dependency's
useful but not logically necessary.

I don't think these dependency relationships can be expressed merely by the
topology of the tree, as you suggest. We will need to deal with dependency
rules as a separate issue.

Yes, of course. There are varied sources for the structured data. It still
seems to me that capturing the non-text sources will probably be a subset of
what's needed to capture the text sources. This is because textual
descriptions are probably the least formally structured data we need to deal

character (margin). This seems odd to many people thinking traditionally
about characters/states. Let's agree that we'll use them interchangeably for
now.

| Kevin's representation is too focused on text descriptions.  A more
complete
| representation might be:
|
| <character name="leaf">
|   <state>present</state>
|   <character name="leaf margin">

|   </character>
| </character>

I would argue that this is a less complete representation, because you've
abstracted the original data further than I have.

I won't use the "markup" from my last email for "Leaf margins serrate with
forward-pointing teeth", as this was designed to exemplify one limited
problem (how to expand a description if characters are nested) and wasn't
actually marked up in the way I proposed for challenge case 1. Two possible
ways I'd do this example are:

"Leaf margins serrate with forward-pointing teeth"

{Using the rule "<states>s cannot have <characters>s as siblings"}

<Feature><Name>Leaf</Name>
 <Feature name = "Presence" value = "Present">
 <Feature Name="marginal toothing">margins
  <Value>serrate</Value>
 </Feature> with
 <Feature Name = "tooth orientation">
  <State>forward-pointing</State> teeth
 </Feature>
</Feature>

{Relaxing the rule so that <states>s can have <characters>s as siblings}

<Feature><Name>Leaf</Name>
 <Feature name = "Presence" value = "Present">
 <Feature Name="marginal toothing">margins
  <Value>serrate</Value> with
  <Feature Name = "tooth orientation">
   <State>forward-pointing</State> teeth
  </Feature>
 </Feature>
</Feature>

Your proposal is:

<character name="leaf">
  <state>present</state>
  <character name="leaf margin">
    <state>serrate</state>
    <character name = "tooth orientation">
      <state>forward-pointing</state>
    </character>
  </character>
</character>

The score:

1. Can we parse from these the data atoms "leaf = present "leaf margin =
serrate" and "tooth orientation = forward-pointing"?

Kevin's = Yes  Steve's = Yes

Can we easily retrieve from these the original natural language string?

Kevin's = Yes  Steve's = No

On this scoring I'm one up. Then again, yours would be slightly easier to
parse than mine, so we're probably equal. What's most important here? Dunno.

Further, it seems to me that yours is a subset of mine: a Schema that
allowed mine would also allow yours, but not vice versa.

I agree - there's still too much complex logic even in the very simple types

more basic examples to tease these issues out.

Which is not all that difficult... to mark up a single description
manually is a relatively trivial task... but to process a lot
automatically is another matter... and to do it in a way that the whole
community accepts is another matter entirely...  :)

becasue it creates mixed content (legal, but evil) where the data is
parsable, but not structured. If we can not represent our data universe
in a database in an elegant and easily understood way we may not
necessarily have failed, but we will have fallen short of the target by
a large margin.

In fact, DELTA already does this  sort of thing by allowing liberal
appending and prepending <freeform comments> all over the place. While
this makes for quasireadable descriptions, authors often embed
interesting character data in the comments making it unusable by other
applications, even within the DELTA suite.  The 'rarely' and
'misinterpreted' scoring options in Lucid might be seen as an attempt
to capture some of this information.

I agree...  this is a laudable aim... but I must admit to never thinking
of a structured document as a subset of a marked up description -
oftentimes the reverse may be the case... Isn't it better to think of
both structured documents and marked up descriptions as being subsets
of the standard we are trying to create?

> Personally I think that creating an XML representation of structured data

But as we have seen, getting everyone to agree that one person's way
of doing it is the one true and proper path to descriptive enlightenment
is no easy task...

Well, dreaming about it at least... I think we are dealing with two
different, and I fear irreconsilable things here...  descriptions by
their very nature are lossy - they are abstract representations of the
gestalt of a sample of a taxon, often with an arbitrary word limit,
attempting to portray in a familiar format what an author thinks a taxon
looks like.  Structured documents such as DELTA and Lucid at least have
to potential to store everything that is remotely interesting about
every taxon in the set and often come close to achieving it in reality.
So what if the resulting descriptions do not have the poetic beauty of
a Shakespearian sonnet; at least the information will be there and
retrievable... In the case of biological description, beauty is not
necessarily truth, or at least the whloe truth...

> Anyone else out there +/- agree with me, or should I give up now?

Don't do that... if you do, you will never have anything to write home
about...

But it is important that we sort it out...  Dependency can be expressed
in ways other than allowing the ultimate state to be a parent of a
character, can't it?  This would seem to be very messy and recursive and
would probably break the clean hierarchical representation of data we
seemed to be aiming towards.

Well, this is important, isn't it?  I think we have just established
that our model must accomodate two kinds of dependency one based on
logic andaracter tree topology, an the other based on content/context.
In the former a character can not be present because to parent
feature/character/organ is absent; in the latter it could conceivalbly
be present, but just isn't.  Up till now applications have just allowed
scoring dependencies without making this distinction.

I agree with this.  We need to bear it in mind, but let's try and nail
down a basic descriptive framework first...

These <freeform comments> are natural-language paragraphs embedded
in otherwise fully parsable data, which is the opposite of Kevin's
case above.  And much easier to handle, I think.

I put interesting data in the comments for an extremely important
reason:  I know I don't have enough data to represent the probable
diversity in the taxon (the item), and I do not want to understate
the diversity.  Better to leave the character coded as unknown,
but record the data.  At some point in the future, the data can be
moved from the comments to where it belongs.

And I think we have all become bilingual in this regard...

But sooner rather than later I would like us to nail this terminology
down, to free up the synonyms forus elsewhere in our model as much as
anything else...

Also, I am not yet convinced that unbounded nesting of characters is
necessary the best way to go in terms of representing a hioerarch of
character data... but maybe it is...

At the end of the day, a state of a particular character  (or a value of
a feature) is used in a key decision or choice and the hierachy is not
all that important other than the order of presentation orlogical
grouping of characters.  In the description the hierarch similar
provides the logical order of the characters and their states/values.

Perhaps we could use features for the hierachy and characters for
the ultimate branch.  For example features could contain features or
characters (but not both) and characters would have states which would
have values (present, absent, doubtful, rarely, in error, or whatever, or
a measurement/count).

Reaching agreement of this level of data description, and the terminology
we are going to use would seem to be essential for clear and unambiguous
communication within the group.

But if we can't agree, I can wait... because we aregoing to have to doit
sooner or later...

That is an intersting perspecitve, and probably right...  but although
coming from different directions, is there a real difference in the
final result?  Both end up as mixed content of structured (and parsable
character data interspersed with free form text...

Absolutely... and isn't this the holy grail we are seeking in this
descriptive data standard?  I am quite sure that the model we come up
with with have a structured place for this freeform and comment
stuff... to do anything less will be to admit failure...

Subject:      Questions on Dependencies and identifiers
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

        I am still working through Challenge 1, modifiying my data model so
that it can completely model the text descriptions. I am now stuck on two
problems that arose when I was trying to work through the practical
implications of the model.

 First, I am stuck trying to adequately model the structure and dependencies
of the leaf apex characters
"apex obtuse or minutely mucronate within an apical notch". I am parsing
this out as:

Apex shape
        obtuse
        notched

Apex projection
        immucronate
        mucronate within notch (dependent on 'Apex shape - notched')

The model has an attribute for 'dependent on' under the character element.
Does the proper solution of this problem require a 'dependent on' attribute
as part of the //character/state element as well? Am I parsing the data
correctly?


        The first problem led me to the second problem, which is: how do we
identify the character or state another character depends on?  This is not a
problem when working with DELTA format data which has unique identifiers
already, but text descriptions do not.  Is an Xpath description adequate or
do we need to be able to have a structure that allows us to uniquely
identify what a character state describes?
        I originally thought a  unique identifier was needed to identify
missing data not explicitly encoded in the description and to provide a
pointer to characters or states that are other characters of states depend
on.  Now that I see how complex this may be to implement, I'm wondering if
another way would be better.
        I originally included an attribute called 'describes' under the
//character/state element. I thought that this could be used for two
purposes: (1) to add descriptive text to the character state and (2) to help
build a unique identifier for a character state.  The first use is no
problem; this structure allows an author to easily add "high' to the value
for the character state describing height for example.  The structure is
less useful for building an identifier for what the character state
describes.
        I thought I could build a unique identifier by combining the
character name and the 'describes' attribute. So for

        <Character>
                <CharName>Leaf</Charname>
                <State describes="PlaneShape" modifier="+/-">oblong</State>
        </Character>

The identifier 'LeafPlaneShape' identifies what the state describes.  This
allows you to recognize that even when there are multiple states (ie.
'ovate', 'round', etc.) they are all describing one aspect of the leaf.  If
nested characters are recognized, the identifier must get longer.
'ApexShape' or 'ApexProjection' wouldn't work, it would have to be
'LeafApexShape' or 'LeafApexProjection'.  If the nesting gets deep, this
gets awkward pretty fast. It would work, though.
        Do others think that having an identifier is necessary and, if so,
has anyone been able to come up with a better way to handle it? Is Xpath
adequate to our needs?

Thanks,
Kerry

Maybe...  but is there a correct answer to this in the absence of
context?  Without knowing what the other taxa in the application are, you
could get away with:

        Apex shape
                obtuse
                minutely mucronate in an apical notch
Or even, trivially:
        Apex shape
                obtuse or minutely mucronate in an apical notch

It maybe that there are only two character states in this group of taxa -
the bluntish ones with obtuse/mucronate tips and the sharp ones with
acute/attenuate tips.  In this case building a line of dependency might
not only be unnecessary, but might it also be misleading?

But I do not this that was the real issue, was it?  The challenge was,
if you had a dependency, how would you deal with it...

Is there any harm in requiring a unique id for each node? Most
descritpive applications probably do this already to manage their data
matrices. DELTA lets you see them which is considered mabye useful,
Lucid doesn't which is considered healthy... :)

Is our structure/Schema/DTD is right, it would be nice to think that it
was self referenceing and that we did not have to worry about internal
ids and pointers, wouldn't it...

Thinking further about Kevin's two types of dependency, context and
content (or whatever the terminology was), isn't the former an artifact
of the character set we have decided to use and the latter an artifact
of the taxa we are covering? The former is just not possible, the latter
might be possible but is just not there.  If this really is the case and
one sort of dependency arises from the character state and another
arises from the taxa being considered, then it is very likely that they
should be modelled in slightly or completely different ways.

//character/state is not always going to be unique is it? The tip
mucronate, obtuse, acute condition could exist in scales, bracts,
leaves, petals, sepals, anthers, etc. A more complete path is going to
have to be specified which could get pretty nasty...  but hey, computers
are good at nasty...

but not very elegantly...
Dependency is the act of a state/value controlling the applicability or
otherwise of a character/feature or as Kevin has pointed out a taxon
controlling a character feature (in the identification process this get
s bit circular as you have to hav an idea what a taxon is before you can
decide if a character is inapplicable, but such knowledge can be built
into the data in various ways).  Thus the model will have to accommodate
that a certain character/feature is unavailable if a certain state/value
exists, perhaps in a totally different branch of the character/feature
tree - and the obligate reciprocal relationship between controlling
state/values and controlled characters/feataures.  Unique ids, even
arbitrary sequential numeric ones a la DELTA, might be the best (or an
adequate) way to do this.

How about:

<feature id="123">
        <feateName>leaf</featureName>
                <character id="6" nullcharacter="3" nullstate="4">
                        <characterName>leaf shape</characterName>
                        <state modifier="+/-" value="present">oblong</State>
                        <state value="rarely">ovate</State>
                        <state value="rarely">obovate</State>
                </character>
</feature>

... just doodling...  maybe this needs to be specified in a separate
characterlist up front, rather than in the guts of the descriptive data.

Actually we have not even decided that yet have we?  Should the list of
characters/states and the lists of taxa be described as separate blocks,
or should they be implied from the content and structure of the standard
data file.  I prefer the former and both DELTA and Lucid do this... but
have we decided that this is the way to go?

I always have problems with Xpath - it is supposed to work, but I always

This resulted from c.10 minutes thinbking in response to Steve's point. It
does seem to be true that there are these 2 types of dependencies, but we
need to think much more about (a) whether they need to be treated
differently and (b) whether there aren't even more types.

Again, shall we keep this thread going or set it aside to pick up later. I'm
inclined to the latter.

Barry - these are just the sort of problems that Challenge 1 was designed to
throw up. In retrospect, though, it's perhaps too complex already. Maybe as
we consider it we can break it up into sub-challenges?

Dependencies are indeed a large issue that need to be dealt with carefully.
Should we set them aside for the time being or do you want to deal with them
now?

When I put in that bit about mucronate within a notch my thought was that
there would be two states "obtuse" and "mucronate within an apical notch"
and obviously Jim's right that it's dependent on the context - the other
taxa in the treatment - whether to treat it like this or otherwise.

Your interpretation:

| Apex shape
|         obtuse
|         notched
|
| Apex projection
|         immucronate
|         mucronate within notch (dependent on 'Apex shape - notched')

seems to have a dependency between a state of one character and a state of
another character (I'll use the character/state terminology for the time
being here for simplicity). This is not the way it's usually done -
dependencies usually set up a relationship between an entire character and a
state of another character. e.g. the character Leaf shape ovate/elliptic
will be dependent on the state "present" of the character "Leaves
present/absent". In an interactive key the behaviour will be that if someone
chooses Leaves absent then the character Leaf Shape will disappear. Likewise
when building natural language descriptions, if a taxon has no leaves then
the leaf descriptive characters will all be skipped.

You seem to be doing something else here, and I'm not sure what's the
behaviour you were trying to get.

Can you give us a fragment of your model for the simplest case extractable
from Challenge 1, without the complications of numeric characters,
dependencies etc.

Yes, there's a real need for character lists and identifiers. Do we go with
e.g.

<Feature Name = "Leaves">
    <Value>ovate</Value>
</Feature>

or <Feature FeatureID="23" valueID = "6">

The former certainly makes for better human-readability, but is this
important?

I would have thought that a computer can make sense of either, and we can
support both. The parser would simply need to know that if the attribute
FeatureID is specified then use that and look up the idref to get the name,
else if the attribute Name is specified then use that.

Presumably our document structure will be the same whether we use Names or
Idrefs?

Hi all you XML gurus,

Has anyone had any experience storing HTML markup within an XML document. I
would like to have a document that describes a species and one of the
attributes is a descriptive piece of text  eg.

<species_comments>The nature of <i>Carcinus maenas</i> is blah blah
blah.</species_comments>

What I would like to do is have this attribute parsed using XSL and retain
the formatting over species names. When the text is processed normally the
HTML tags are dropped. If it is kept as CDATA the tags are not dropped but
also not processed. Any clues how to handle this?

Cheers

In one test application where plant names embedded in text were surrounded
by <taxon></taxon> (more meaningful than <i></i>), I fudged it using
fragments like the following xsl:

                 <xsl:for-each select="note">
                         <p class="note">
                                 <xsl:apply-templates/>
                         </p>
                 </xsl:for-each>
                 ....
                 <xsl:template match="taxon">
                         <i>
                                 <xsl:apply-templates/>
                         </i>
                 </xsl:template>

which spewed the output to browser compatible html.   The result was a
series of note paragraphs with italicised species names...  Not very
elegant, pretty trivial, and I am not particularly proud of it.  But hey,
it worked and current IE and NS browsers knew what to do with it...

That's because you're hitting the default template rules, which strips elements
but retains their content.

> If it is kept as CDATA the tags are not dropped but
> also not processed.

If you mean you've got &lt;i>Carcinus maenas&lt;/i> or something similar,
then the XSLT processor won't treat them as tags, but text.

>Any clues how to handle this?

You need a template rule that copies over the contents of this element
into the result tree unchanged.

something like:

<xsl:template match="species_comments">
  <xsl:copy>
     <xsl:copy-of select="@*"/>
     <xsl:apply-templates/>
  </xsl:copy>
</xsl:template>

This should copy the contents unchanged (including attributes) into the
output.

HtH,

Cheers,

L.

Except for this kind of usage. Mixed content is perfect for marking up
free-form text. Bad for mapping data into data structures (in most
cases a database).

If I had XML data containing this structure, I'd simply store the contents
as the raw XML.

This is how I would like to do business as well, but unfortunately once
you do this in common databases, they lose access to all the useful
structural stuff in there...

One day 'xml' might be a common database content type, up there with
text, integers, real numbers, dates and the like, with real database
facilities to manage and use this content... maybe it is already
there... somewhere...

Dear collegues

as has been announced at the TDWG meeting in Sydney we are planning 2
workshops in March 2002 to discuss the topic that remain open during the
email discussions.

Karen Wilson and Nicolas Bailly have informed me that the dates of the other
meetings are fixed.

For the Workshop in Sydney the best dates seem to be the 13-14 March 2002.
Please inform me if you think that we should try to find another date that
fits into the BioForum 2 schedule (see
http://plantnet.rbgsyd.gov.au/bioforum/index.html)

For Paris, we may have a choice between the 6. and 10. of March. Please send
me a direct mail (g.hagedorn@bba.de) if you are considering attending this
extra 1 day workshop in Paris, and write which day you would prefer.

I wish all of you a very nice Christmas celebration and holiday,
Best wishes

Hi Gregor,

Sorry for the long silence.

Regarding the upcoming meeting, there will be a number of GBIF related
meetings around the same time and the dates for some of these haven't been
settled (one of them may even be in Mexico!).  Right now March 13/14 should
be fine for me and I would prefer Canberra with Sydney possible.

Thanks for your time and trouble working on this meeting.

Dear colleagues,

Please excuse again the delay. I was away since Tuesday of last week
and failed doing this before leaving.

1. Nicolas Bailly was very kind to offer the possibility of an
additional "European" meeting in Paris in conjunction with another
meeting. However, except for Nicolas, perhaps Yde de Jong, and me, we
have no participants, so we will not hold that meeting and hope to
meet at the TDWG meeting in autumn.

2. For the Australian meeting 13/14 March seems to be ok with
everbody.  I got 4 responses to my question regarding the Sydney vs.
Canberra question. 1 was neutral, 2 prefer Canberra, 1 prefers
Sydney. So Canberra is preferred.

However, the BioForum 2 schedule (see
http://plantnet.rbgsyd.gov.au/bioforum/index.html) is much clearer
now and I think we should meet in Sydney! Immediately after our
meeting a Workshop for an Electronic Catalogue of Names of Known
Organisms: "TOWARDS A CATALOGUE OF LIFE" will be held at the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Australia, 15-16 March, 2002. The draft
programme is not on the web yet.

The funding decision on which my travel money depends should have
been in last week, but I haven't heard it yet. Assuming it goes
through, Sydney seems the better place, since the Catalogue of life
meeting is immediately afterwards.

Originally I had the impression that some GBIF meetings in Canberra
may be occurring before that day, but now it seems that all Canberra
is Tuesday 19th-Fri. 22th. So either we could meet in Canberra
earliest Sa/Sun 23/24th, or well ahead of Sydney and leave at least
one day travel time. As I understand, Bob has made early travel
plans, I understand he will be in Canberra 10th March.

We could meet 11-13 in Canberra, then have 1 day extra day to travel
to Sydney. That would exclude some people who may want to pop in
before the Sydney meeting, but we don't know about that, so we should
stick to our core group.

Karen Wilson has offered to provide us with a room in Sydney, I
assume Steve would do the same for Canberra.

Please answer in direct mail to g.hagedorn@bba as soon as possible:
_Will_ you come to a meeting:

Canberra 11-13   Yes/No
Canberra 12-13   Yes/No
Sydney 12-14     Yes/No
Sydney 13-14     Yes/No

I will collect all answers until tomorrow, Tuesday evening and send
the conclusion round on Wednesday morning UTC.

or he is welcome to do so.

It will be a small group, but I hope we can do much hard work. We
will attempt to finish a draft of an xml schema in a exiting working
session.

Everybody who cannot participate will be informed about the
preliminary results, so that no final decisions will be made until
the next TDWG meeting in autumn 2002 (I still do not know where it
will be), where I hope more people will be able to attend.

Those who are planning to come please send a confirmation mail to
G.Hagedorn@bba.de. I have asked Karen Wilson to provide us with a
small room with an internet connection, many thanks to her!

Best wishes

Dear colleagues,

A new option arose and I want to open the discussion again:

Several people who may attend prefer Canberra. Who could meet in
Canberra 19-22, rather than 12-14 Sydney. I could probably handle
this just as well, and so can Bob Morris (I think...).

If anybody has already made travel plans based on yesterdays
announcement: please email me directly, this would veto any change.

Hi Gregor,

Is the TDWG-SDD meeting going to be 12-14 in Sydney after all?  Hope to =
see you there,

Liz.

Dear friends,

the situation is slightly confusing for me, because I do not know who
may attend. I think what has evolved so far is that:

A small meeting will be 11-12/11-13 in Canberra. Everybody is welcome
who can make it, but so far only I, Bob, and Kevin are certain to
attend.

We will then move to Sydney to the Catalogue of Life/Bioforum II on
March 15/16th.

I would like to have another meeting there, in the hope that we can
attract more people there. This could be either on 14th immediately
before the meeting or 17th (which is Sunday) or after.

What I need to know is who would attend to this meeting?

I have information from Stan Blum and Liz Kolster, who are
considering to come. Anybody else thinking about it?

Gregor,

Sorry for the silence...
I can be present for both of these events (CANB + 14 or 17th)- just
point me in the right direction.  Jim is away, but I would think he
will in attendance.

I was hoping for a meeting of the collections subgroup as well, seeing
that quite a few of the players will be here ( or there).  heard nothing
  yet.

Anyway, I will set aside the week.  See you then.

Do we have a Canberra venue?
If not, I could organize something here at the Garden?

Gregor,

While it is not finalised just who is coming from PERTH, one of us will
almost certainly be able to attend.
>From our perspective we would favour sticking with the dates as
originally suggested for TDWG-SDD ie. 13-14 March in order to maximise

Dear colleagues,

the dates of the meeting have now been fixed! We tried to involve as
many people as possible, which meant splitting the meeting between
Sydney and Canberra. We will meet:

March 11-12: Premeeting in Canberra, probably at the Botanical
Garden. The meeting will start March 11th at 9:30 am and last for 2
full days. We plan an intensive working session to elaborate an xml-
schema draft. It will be a small, but open working session. List of
confirmed participants: J. Croft (probably), G. Hagedorn, B. Morris,
K. Thiele, Greg Whitbread, E. Zurcher.

March 13-14: SDD meeting in Sydney at the Botanical Garden. The
meeting will start March 13th at 1 pm in the afternoon

Please send direct email to g.hagedorn@bba.de if you plan to attend
either meeting. This will help our friends who organize the rooms to
plan the right size of room for us.

I am also collecting any specific contributions or points you want to
make for an agenda.

See also http://www.diversitycampus.net/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html

meetings.

Dear SDD participants,

The group has been dormant for a while. The minutes of the meeting in
Canberra and Sydney were prepared already a while ago, but had asked
several participants to check them, since we made substantial
progress there. This took some time, and then I did not manage to get
back to SDD from my own work on the GLOPP project.

Anyway, the SDD pages:
  http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html

are updated, and
- contain the minutes (rather long "minutes")
- the xml example document and
- xml-schema elaborated in March, and
- Information on the upcoming TDWG meeting in Brazil.

I realize that participation may be difficult for some interested,
but I do hope many can come. We have decided to split the time into 2
days for more theoretical basical discussions (14/15) and two days
for practical work on the schema (16/17) with input from those
involved in development.

Please send me any corrections regarding the minutes and I will
update them!

I hope to see you in October

best wishes

Dear colleagues,

I look forward seeing many of you in Brazil. I am very happy that
more people can attend now than we initially expected.

We will meet at the reception of the Vitoria hotel on Monday 14, at
9:30. The meeting room will be in the hotel. If you arrive later, the
hotel staff should be able to point you to the room. You can drop
into the meeting at any time you desire [you just won't get out again
:-)].

The agenda is open for your contributions! If you have specific
points you can mail me until Friday afternoon GMT.

My own priorities which I believe we absolutely need to finish would
be to clarify the use of data types, esp. categorical, numerical, and
textual information, esp. in comparison with DELTA vs. xml, and to
clarify and finalize the definitions of special character states
(unknown, unchecked, not applicable, variable, etc.). I believe after
this the definition from Australia will already start to become
usable.

Best wishes

I know this is slightly unfair, since I have not managed to finish

like to announce it to those not present in Brazil:

* We plan to meet in Paris on February 13-14th.
* The meeting is organized by Nicolas Bailly!

If you can come to this meeting, please do so everybody is welcome.
The minutes and the xml-schema should be out soon, probably before
New Years eve. If anybody would to see them beforehand, I can mail
it.

Best wishes

and merry Christmas to all of you

Gregor,

Do you have any more information about this meeting (agenda, start/end
times)?  I would like to come, but am under great pressure over the next
couple of months, so I'm trying to work out what meetings I really must
attend.

I am assuming from your note that you have sufficient funds for this
meeting, and that any GBIF funds I might apply for SDD might be better used
for another meeting later this year.  Is this correct?

Thanks,

Donald

Subject: SDD Meeting Paris!

Dear Colleagues,

I know this is slightly unfair, since I have not managed to finish
the minutes from Brazil, but: a new meeting is coming up and I would
like to announce it to those not present in Brazil:

* We plan to meet in Paris on February 13-14th.
* The meeting is organized by Nicolas Bailly!

If you can come to this meeting, please do so everybody is welcome.
The minutes and the xml-schema should be out soon, probably before
New Years eve. If anybody would to see them beforehand, I can mail
it.

Best wishes

and merry Christmas to all of you

Gregor

Dear colleagues

I am running late with working through the SDD development from
Brazil. I spent most available time this week, but that was not
enough.

However, a valid xml schema and example document is now available
(sorry Bob, the one I emailed you wasn't!) and I have the minutes 90%
done and have uploaded all to the SDD site
(http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html).

The first pages and all links are checked and readable. However, at
some point I have put in a marker, so that if you don't have to,
refrain from reading on. There should be a better version after the
weekend for you.

Thanks, I look forward to the meeting in Paris. I am drawing up an
agenda of what I consider priorities, but please contact me with the
things you think should be done first.

Hello everybody,

Rather _really_ late, but the minutes and the start page are now as
good as I can get them for the moment. Please read the minutes from
Brazil. For those coming to the meeting it would be perhaps helpful
for us if you can print them out, so we can refer to them.

Some people have notified me that there were broken links yesterday;
I hope I have fixed all hyperlinks now.

I can be reached by email up to Wednesday, 11:00 GMT. If you sent
comments after that time, please mail to TDWG-SDD@USOBI.ORG; we will
keep checking that list during the meeting.

Best wishes, I see forward to the meeting

How in XML-schema do you make sure that of two possible child
elements, either or both, but not neither are present?

Parent
 A

Parent
 B

Parent
 A
 B

should all be ok, but not Parent without either A or B. Attached is a
small ZIP file with example files.

Paris was a good meeting, I am working on the minutes!

Thanks!

How about changing the model to 'choice' and requiring one but allowing two
(or multiple) occurrences of optional elements?

something like this maybe?

Dosn't it alllow the choice whithout A nor B for their minOccurs=0?

Substition group would do.

Hello:

Wouldn=B4t this allow for the case when there are two A's or two B's?

I haven't tried it yet but, I just glanced at the spec and found an =
example that would yield something like this if applied:

<?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs=3D"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" =

                   <xs:group   ref=3D"elementABopt"/>
                   <xs:element ref=3D"elementB" minOccurs=3D"1"/>
        </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

</xs:element>

<xs:element name=3D"elementA">
</xs:element>

<xs:element name=3D"elementB">
</xs:element>

Do you see any problem here (besides complexity?)

Hope this helps...

Wouldn't this example too would allow for 2 B's?  It may be messy
(especially if you progress beyond two elements), but couldn't you just =
use
a choice allowing for only one of an A-B group, an A or a B?

That was also my idea (see attached files), however it is prohibited for=20

Hello Donald:

I'm sorry, I have to say I really don=B4t know because I haven=B4t tried =
it out.
I just thought it wouldn't allow for 2 B's if you had to choose first =
between an A[B] element and a B element.
But anyway I couldn't agree more with you: it surely gets too messy, =
specially if it's one of the first elements in the hierarchy, as this =
seems the case.

See you next week,

William.

Wouldn't this example too would allow for 2 B's?  It may be messy
(especially if you progress beyond two elements), but couldn't you just =
use
a choice allowing for only one of an A-B group, an A or a B?

Hello:

Wouldn=B4t this allow for the case when there are two A's or two B's?

I haven't tried it yet but, I just glanced at the spec and found an
example that would yield something like this if applied:

<?xml version=3D"1.0" encoding=3D"UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs=3D"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

                   <xs:element ref=3D"elementB" minOccurs=3D"1"/>
           </xs:choice>

                    </xs:sequence>
        </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

<xs:element name=3D"elementA">
</xs:element>

<xs:element name=3D"elementB">
</xs:element>

</xs:schema>

Do you see any problem here (besides complexity?)

Hope this helps...

Greetings,

William.

How about changing the model to 'choice' and requiring one but allowing
two
(or multiple) occurrences of optional elements?

something like this maybe?

Hi all,

I suppose William Ullate is right way; nevertheless, his example isn't
completed and doesn't work.

The correct syntax of William code is here:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
elementFormDefault="qualified" attributeFormDefault="unqualified">

 <xs:element name="Parent">
  <xs:complexType>
   <xs:choice>
    <xs:group ref="elementAoptB"/>
    <xs:element ref="elementB" minOccurs="1"/>
   </xs:choice>
  </xs:complexType>
 </xs:element>
 <xs:group name="elementAoptB">
  <xs:sequence>
   <xs:element name="elementA" minOccurs="1"/>
   <xs:element ref="elementB" minOccurs="0"/>
  </xs:sequence>
 </xs:group>

 <xs:element name="elementB"/>
</xs:schema>

This work fine.

Hi all once more,

if there is a problem of messy schema or complexity of this approach for
developers, it is possible to add "processing" validation layer using
Schematron or XSLT template - simply by adding the Schematron or XSLT code
to xs:appinfo element of schema documentation. The application can parse
schema, read code and execute it and report results of additional
validation to user (or to some process).

To catch such problems by Schematron or XSLT is deadly simple. And more, we
can meet worse problems, where the XML schema is absolutely unusable - for
example, dependence "if element A has value X, then value of element B must
fall between Y and Z". In such case, Schematron and XSLT approach is only
possible. Moreover, it is possible to include all such dependencies into
one Schematron/XSLT code.

Ah.  I didn't read Gregor's description as excluding multiplication of

Hi,

thanks everybody for the responses and help. I am only just back from
a trip so I could not respond earlier.

I agree that the:

choice
  A_required_with_B_optional
  B_required
/choice

approach is working (albeit it makes the schema a bit difficult to
read). The suggestions to put a minOccurs on the choice compositor
containing optional elements is not working: having no element is
fine for schema (at least with validator built into xmlspy). Also it
could lead to an A-A sequence.

James: Yes, having <Parent><A/><A/></Parent> is undesirable, it
should really be a choice of two alternative expressions of a fact.

Examples are where a definition may either be inline directly given
free-form text or a URI pointing to another place, or both, but not
neither. Two inline definition elements would be difficult to
interpret (whats the difference between the two? Semantics of using
one or multiple?...) In this example multiple URIs would in fact be
allowable, but in other examples not).

Pavel: You are right about additional validation in xslt. It is
needed elsewhere already, but work on that has to come later.

Thanks again

Gregor

"Aggregate" when referring to moving shared characteristics up a level in
the taxonomy.

"Inherit" properties when going down the hierarchy.

Does "inherit" carry too much baggage from genetics and programming? It
might be good baggage to have.

Ich halte meinen Beitrag nicht für die Liste wert, vielleicht sollte man
das Wort (engl.) "consilience" oder "consilation" (aus lat. "consilere")
prüfen, ob es besser passt ?

  Consilience. The fact of ,jumping together, or agreeing; coincidence, concurrence;
  said of the accordance of two or more inductions drawn from different
  groups of phenomena.   OED online

I don't think this conveys that several concepts are being collated
(which I don't like because it often implies a natural order). Rather
it would seem to imply that several things mean or imply the same
thing.

However, the second meaning for 'collation' in the OED is "The action
of bringing together and comparing; comparison.", which might in fact
meet Gregor's needs. So maybe I should withdraw my dislike.

couldn't we call that induction?
here is a definition :
"Induction is the process of inference employed in "inductive logic".
A mode of reasoning that starts with specific facts and concludes
general hypotheses or theories"

here, species descriptions are observed fact and genus description is
inducted

and this term is less general than infer

I would call it "abstract". Rather like one creates an abstract data
type in programming, or one can also create objects that are abstract
representations, or models, of real-world things.

I feel uneasy about calling the inheritance or deduction process an
"aggregation" or "compilation". That may be a language point. Also I
would think:

induction = parent properties inferred from multiple children

deduction = child properties inferred from (direct or remote) parents

What then would your definition of "inference" as a third specific
methodology be?

Yes and no. Or Perhaps...?

I think we need to explore this up/down topic on the taxonomic tree.
Some information you want to inherit (i.e. child inherits from
parten), other characters you don't because there is you know the
character is too variable. You also want to contradict, but that is
probably automatic if you enter data. However, if you enter data in a
character downwards, you probably want the collation/Inheritance
process to stop, the new data replace things for the entire
character.

In induction: You may have data about 100 specimen. 99 have states 1
or 2, 1 has state 3. You may want to remove state 3 from the
aggregation process. Also: you may have a family where states 1 and 2
can be inferred by aggregation/induction/collation from below. You
know however this family has also members with state 4 (which are
otherwise not in you dataset). Should the aggregation break or should
it be possible to add state 4 and keep 1 and 2 by
aggregation/induction?

Perhaps the process of making informed scientific decisions should be
called the collation process. The algorithmic methods could be called

aggregation = induction of knowledge
inheritance = deduction of knowledge

???

If "inducing" (not "inducting") a genus concept ("description")
is unacceptable, then how about "synthesizing" a genus
description ("concept") from the data garnered from the
to-be-included species definitions (concepts)? (And, do other
"related" genera/species influence one's thinking in the
formulation of this new genus's concept/description too?)

{Sorry for the delay in contributing this, I've been away the past few
days.)

In BioLink, we have the following options/commands:

Compile
        with the options to:=20
                Compile Once
                Always Compile From Children
                Refresh Compile

Inherit
        with the options to:
                Inherit Once
                Always Inherit From Parent
                Refresh Inherit
        =09
We do this independently for each cell or attribute (that is, for each
character for each taxon/item, or for each character by taxon/item
intersection).  This way you can build a full description by compiling
some characters from children while inheriting other characters from the
parent.

We allow you to either regenerate these data automatically (by selecting
the "Always Compile/Inherit from Children/Parent" command) or to create
a static copy of the data so you can fine-tune it by manually inserting
comments and clarifications (with the danger that changes to
children/parents will not be reflected).

Our hope is that by including the phrases "from children" and "from
parent" in the commands that we can make the actions of these commands
clear without having to resort to looking these terms up in the help
files or, worse, a dictionary.

Before finishing the Paris minutes, I have just finished the last
remaining bit from Brazil. On the last day we discussed special
states, which was not really in the minutes released before Paris. I
have written it as a separate document and have tried to work through
some of the issues and scenarios we touched upon in Brazil. These
include character scoping, default or implicit states, inheritance
from taxonomic hierarchy, and a bit on character dependency. The
result is a bit lengthy, but it did help _me_ a lot. I hope that the
document can be pruned down when some parts can be moved elsewhere.

I would love get your comments and feedback. Either sent them to the
list, or if you have small corrections to help me you can write them
into the document (Bob already did a first review helping to remove
the worst logic and language errors!) and send it back to me.

It is available at:

Hi All,

I've had a look at the excellent "Special States" document
(http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/Docs/SDD_P_Data_SpecialStates.htm
l) put together by Gregor and a few comments are attached below.

These comments are in several sections (with a few notes at the bottom).
Have a look at the first and last sections and the long second section
if you are expecially interested.  This second section is pretty long
and rambles a bit, but covers a wide range of issues centred on Gregor's
document.  Hopefully it will help move the SDD forward.

Thanks, Steve

******************************************************************

SDD Special States

At some level the details of the SDD structure are less important than
its content.  This is because few (if any) consuming applications will
use SDD other than as a source of information, this information being
translated into application-specific formats for processing and
analysis.  This requires mapping SDD items to local items and this can
be done for any given SDD structure.

Taking this approach, I would make only one suggestion: generalize,
Generalize, GENERALIZE!  What I mean is that the current Special States
document attempts to define all of the possible Special States that are
to be part of SDD and even goes so far as to exclude some potential
Special States.  I would strongly suggest that SDD have a general method
for handling these, with at most a list of suggested Special States
rather than trying to be too restrictive.  I firmly believe that it will
be extremely difficult (and short sighted) to try to define these as
part of the SDD Standard.  The list of useful Special States is much
longer than the few suggested in the current document, and an extension
is even suggested at the end of the document, a "ToDo" Special State.
Many more can be thought of with little effort.

This same difficulty (trying to be too specific) has arisen in related
activities within TDWG and has resulted in an unfortunate split among
participants.  There are two camps within the specimen-based standards
group, one arguing for a complete description of specimens, the other
looking for a set of common items across most groups.  The first group
has developed a "standard" with some 400 items while the second has
selected in the neighbourhood of 20 or so items.  My impression is that
SDD is taking the first approach: study the problem long enough and the
entire universe of data items and their relationships can be documented.
I'm not confident this is possible.  Biology is too diverse and needs
change too quickly to document all of life in any stable, meaningful and
useful way.  We can provide a framework and make suggestions, but we
won't be successful if we try to dictate too narrowly.

So my suggestion is that we focus on general needs, such as support for
Special States, but that we don't try to define other than at most a few
basic data items (such as general Special States).  What we provide is a
mechanism to support this functionality with the ability to extend it in
a controlled and flexible way.


****************************************************

OK, this is where it gets ugly.  I have a few specific comments on the
current Special States document, some relating to general issues, some
to specific comments.  These are less important than the message above
and largely represent a slightly different perspective on SDD from the
one given in the current document. =20

First, the scope of SDD.  Currently SDD is trying to address three
separate and non-overlapping issues: (1) data, (2) business practices
and (3) application development.  Data is the specific information items
under consideration, business practices are how we think of this items
and how we handle them, and applications are specific pieces of software
used by manage data items.  The current Special States document mixes
these three areas, talking about data items, how people interpreter them
and how they might be displayed by a computer program.  The first area
is clearly within the scope of SDD, the second possibly but only in a
very general, non-specific way, and the third is clearly outside SDD
(and well it should be).  Bob made essentially this same comment when he
said that he thought "project management problems were not part of SDD."
We need to focus on DATA and nothing more.

The second serious problem I have with Special States is that they
aren't "states" in the normal, taxonomic sense.  Taxonomic "states" are
observations made about biological objects (be they taxa or specimens)
that are grouped together as "characters."  We use "states" to describe
items.  However, Special States aren't observable and aren't used to
describe items. =20

What are "Special States"?  They are a mix of two separate sets of
information.  They document the status of data coding (for example
"unknown", "not interpretable" and "unfinished work") and they document
application-specific business rules (for example "use character default
state" - get the data based on a flag set for a specific state of this
character).  These are fundamentally different things and show the
danger of mixing data, business practices and application development. =20

Lack of appreciation for these differences as resulted in "use default"
being treated as a case of "data have not yet been entered" when in fact
a state has been clearly indicated (through a pointer): it's the default
state (however the data or application defines this) and is certainly
known.  It's a user-interface shortcut used by an application to make
data entry quicker (in the opinion of an application developer!).  The
end result is exactly the same as if the state had been entered directly
in the description (the taxon by character intersection, or what DELTA
calls the Attribute).

This thinking results in some very complex processing being required by
consumers of SDD documents.  For example, it is suggested that if a
description is null, then the "special state" called "use default"
should be inserted and that this "state" be set to "not yet evaluated."
This means that to interpret an SDD document you not only have to
understand the individual data items but also know the rules for
processing them (to know that if data is missing you need to insert a
special value and then look this value up in another list to translate
it into something meaningful).  There must be a cleaner way to do this!

The "unknown", "not interpretable" and similar "special states" are
another problem altogether.  These "states" have nothing to do with
characters and everything to do with descriptions.  This is why Mike
Dallwitz didn't include them as part of the Character List.  I can
understand why you might want to treat these as "states" of characters
as this is the basic DELTA paradigm.  However, there is no need to do
this and doing so only complicates things.  For example, to tell if a
description has not been coded you'll need to get its state(s) and then
check their translations to see if any are "unknown", "not
interpretable" or any one of who knows how many other special
conditions.

A much better way to implement this functionality would be to store an
"uncoded" flag with the description along with an (encoded or
text-based) explanation ("unknown", "not interpretable", "too lazy to
code this", "don't have proper specimens", "To Do" or what ever).  This
is both direct and allows the explanation to change in a simple and
flexible way.

These are the most serious and fundamental problems I have with the
current document.  I would also add the following minor comments (some
of these expand on the above comments as well).

The meaning of the DELTA "U" in attributes:  It's stated in the document
that this means "attempts to research the information were made but
failed" and that "the state U in DELTA is also used for cases where data
are present, but the author is unable to interpret them in current
terminology."  The DELTA documentation states simply that "A missing
attribute is equivalent to an attribute with pseudo-value U" and that
"If the state of the character is unknown, then the character is
omitted, or the state value coded as U."  I can't find anything in the
DELTA documentation that gives a reason for the use of U or suggests
that "attempts to research the information were made but failed" or
anything similar.  It would seem that DELTA treats nulls and U as the
same, nothing more.

Remove all sections dealing with "performance", "user-interfaces" and
referring to "applications."  These deal with specific software
developments and should not influence the SDD standard.

Great care should be taken when developing "business rules" for
interpreting an SDD document.  For example see the discussion starting
with "One frequent situation is that characters are added to the
terminology.  Possible solutions to achieve a synchronization between
descriptions and a separate terminology in this case are:".  It may be
important for SDD to document this situation but HOW it is dealt with is
up to individual applications and has little to do with the data itself
(which is the focus of SDD).  The same problem occurs with the statement
"The omission of character coding in a description should be used to
express the "use default" state."  This mixes data with processing.  The
lack of data is simply that - it implies nothing more and NO assumptions
should be made about it.  If the default state should be used then the
author needs to state this.

What does "terminology" mean?  It seems to be the character/character
state list but this is unclear.  It might be good to develop a glossary
of terms so we all know what we're talking about.

We also need to define "schema."  My understanding is that a "schema" is
a model of the structure of the data and not the data itself.  If you
add data you don't change the schema (assuming that this addition is
permitted by the schema - it's like adding rows to a database table -
the schema doesn't change, only the data).  But at several points the
document says "... the case that the terminology is changing ("schema
evolution") is ..." or similar.  This sounds like changes to the data
change the schema.  Is this the general view of schema or am I on the
wrong track?

The section discussing "Data have not yet been entered", "Data cannot be
entered" and "Data could have been entered but a deliberate decision was
made not to enter them" seems to mix unrelated cases and is a mess.  The
options listed are (followed by my interpretation of their meaning):
1) "Use character default state": Data is coded and is not missing (see
above).
2) "Unfinished work": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
3) "Not applicable": Data does not logically exist.
4) "Unknown": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
5) "Not interpretable": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
6) "Out of scope": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
7) "Do not need to score": Data is coded and is not missing.
The mix involves data that is being pointed to through a process (No. 1
and 7), data that is impossible to collect (No. 3) and data that can be
collected but hasn't (for a variety of reasons) (No. 2, 4, 5 and 6).
Keep it simple by recording if data is absent and if it is, the reason.
Don't confuse it with application-specific short cuts ("Use default",
"Inherit/Compile from Parent/Children") or personal decisions made by an
author ("it's too hard to code", "this character is unimportant here",
"appropriate specimens are unavailable", etc).  These are distinct
cases.

There are a number of cases where attempts are made to develop lists of
conditions or situations.  For example, it is asked "Should a general
'cannot score' (for any kind of reason) be differentiated into" and then
three situations are listed.  Again, generalise this into "uncoded" with
a text-based explanation ("observation method failed", "incomplete
specimen" or any one of a thousand other reasons).  All the information
is captured and the system is rich enough to handle unforseen
situations.  This approach also fits perfectly with the previous
example.

There is a note that "a general method is planned (@but not yet
formalized!@) in SDD" and that "SDD is considering introducing computed
characters."  We've been at this for at least 2 years now and there are
things that are "planned" or are "being considered" for SDD that we
don't know about?!?!?  Or is there an overall planning document that I'm
not aware of?  WE are SDD, SDD can't be "considering" things in
isolation.

The entire discussion of inheritance and compilation (or what ever we
call it) needs to be though of in a fresh light.  Again, the document
confuses data with process.  For example, it's stated that "it is
desirable that the assumption [of inheritance/compilation] rather than
the inherited data are recorded".  The author of the dataset MUST
present real data, not give a process to get to that data.  Yes, the
author can tell us how they collected the data ("inherited from direct
parent", "compiled using Gouldes Statistic from all coded children", "by
reference to the default state for this character") but they also must
give us the data, not make us go look for it.  The process of
inheritance/compilation is too complex to leave to chance and trying to
define exactly what it means is too error prone.  I would suggest that
inheritance/compilation is an application-based activity, not a
fundamental aspect of the data.  Again, give us the data and separately
tell us how it was derived, don't make us derive it ourselves.

This exact same problem exists with "computed data."  I don't see how or
why an SDD document can contain the value "CouldNotCompute" because the
"generator couldn't compute this".  The "generator" is a piece of
software, not a data representation (which is what SDD is).
"CouldNotCompute" is an error message returned from an application and
it should never end up in an SDD document.  Yet again, if you want to
explain how the data was generated, find, do it, but don't make us
calculate it, we don't know how.

The discussion about "Not supported as special states, but supported
through modifiers" is good but, as above, describes descriptions and not
characters.  That's why inheritance/compilation is included here.

The statement "Special states express knowledge about why data for a
given character are missing in a description and thus make a statement
about the entire character" is interesting.  It says that special states
are about a character in a description.  The point I would make is that
they are primarily about the description, not the character.  They say
nothing about the character's use for other items, and only relate to
this character in this taxon, and this is through the "description."  So
let's focus this document on the description and only discuss the
character when it's appropriate.  This is supported by the statement
that "DELTA does not define the special states in the "character list"
directive: they are implicitly present in each character."  They are not
in the character list because the have little to do with characters.
They are in the DELTA attributes because they have everything to do with
descriptions.  I'm sorry to say that the next statement shows the danger
of letting past developments influence current work (and I'm as guilty
as any): "When a new character is created, DeltaAccess automatically
creates the full set of special states."  In BioLink we attach this
information to the description: you do it when you're coding the data,
not developing the character list.  I don't know which way is better and
as noted above, it probably doesn't matter as each application will
translate the information into a local format anyway.  What we DO need
to do is make sure the SDD format is expressive, flexible and as
application-neutral as possible (and ideally simple).

Most of the discussion under "Relations between declarative character
dependency and special states" seems to deal with developing
applications rather than data representation and may well be outside
SDD.  Sure, document that these dependencies exist and use them to
produce high-quality and internally consistent data, but do this at
application-level, not SDD-level.

The same applies to "Responsibility for validation."  SDD should be
about representing data in a standardized way, not about enforcing
taxonomic business rules or data quality standards.  As SDD will be
represented in XML then this XML document must be well-formed and pass a
check with a DTD or XML-Schema checker.  But SDD shouldn't be
responsible for checking the content of individual data items, that's
the job of authors and their applications.


********************************************************

So, to summarize:

SDD is about data and only data.  These data include characters and
descriptions and (optionally) how these descriptions were developed and
their current status.

SDD is not about process.  Process information can be included but it is
optional and can be safely ignored without data loss.  [I shouldn't have
to process a "use default data" statement to access a complete
description, the appropriate state(s) should be inserted into the
description when the SDD document is prepared with a note on how it was
derived.]

SDD is not about applications.  Discussions concerning user-interfaces
or processing methods should not be included.  [How an application
manages and represents these data is completely independent of how SDD
represents the data.]


********************************

Finally, I want to reconfirm that Gregor has done a fantastic job with
getting us this far and I support his efforts.  My comments are more
about a different perspective rather than any serious flaw in logic.
Most of what is in the document is well presented and relevant to
managing taxonomic descriptions, I'm just not sure it is directly
related to the goals of SDD.

And sorry for going on for so long.  I'll sit down now.

Hi All,

I've had a look at the excellent "Special States" document
(http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/Docs/SDD_P_Data_SpecialStates.htm
l) put together by Gregor and a few comments are attached below.

These comments are in several sections (with a few notes at the bottom).
Have a look at the first and last sections and the long second section
if you are expecially interested.  This second section is pretty long
and rambles a bit, but covers a wide range of issues centred on Gregor's

******************************************************************

SDD Special States

At some level the details of the SDD structure are less important than
its content.  This is because few (if any) consuming applications will
use SDD other than as a source of information, this information being
translated into application-specific formats for processing and
analysis.  This requires mapping SDD items to local items and this can
be done for any given SDD structure.

Taking this approach, I would make only one suggestion: generalize,
Generalize, GENERALIZE!  What I mean is that the current Special States
document attempts to define all of the possible Special States that are
to be part of SDD and even goes so far as to exclude some potential
Special States.  I would strongly suggest that SDD have a general method
for handling these, with at most a list of suggested Special States
rather than trying to be too restrictive.  I firmly believe that it will
be extremely difficult (and short sighted) to try to define these as
part of the SDD Standard.  The list of useful Special States is much
longer than the few suggested in the current document, and an extension
is even suggested at the end of the document, a "ToDo" Special State.
Many more can be thought of with little effort.

This same difficulty (trying to be too specific) has arisen in related
activities within TDWG and has resulted in an unfortunate split among
participants.  There are two camps within the specimen-based standards
group, one arguing for a complete description of specimens, the other
looking for a set of common items across most groups.  The first group
has developed a "standard" with some 400 items while the second has
selected in the neighbourhood of 20 or so items.  My impression is that
SDD is taking the first approach: study the problem long enough and the
entire universe of data items and their relationships can be documented.
I'm not confident this is possible.  Biology is too diverse and needs
change too quickly to document all of life in any stable, meaningful and
useful way.  We can provide a framework and make suggestions, but we
won't be successful if we try to dictate too narrowly.

So my suggestion is that we focus on general needs, such as support for
Special States, but that we don't try to define other than at most a few
basic data items (such as general Special States).  What we provide is a
mechanism to support this functionality with the ability to extend it in
a controlled and flexible way.


****************************************************

OK, this is where it gets ugly.  I have a few specific comments on the
current Special States document, some relating to general issues, some
to specific comments.  These are less important than the message above
and largely represent a slightly different perspective on SDD from the
one given in the current document.

First, the scope of SDD.  Currently SDD is trying to address three
separate and non-overlapping issues: (1) data, (2) business practices
and (3) application development.  Data is the specific information items
under consideration, business practices are how we think of this items
and how we handle them, and applications are specific pieces of software
used by manage data items.  The current Special States document mixes
these three areas, talking about data items, how people interpreter them
and how they might be displayed by a computer program.  The first area
is clearly within the scope of SDD, the second possibly but only in a
very general, non-specific way, and the third is clearly outside SDD
(and well it should be).  Bob made essentially this same comment when he
said that he thought "project management problems were not part of SDD."
We need to focus on DATA and nothing more.

The second serious problem I have with Special States is that they
aren't "states" in the normal, taxonomic sense.  Taxonomic "states" are
observations made about biological objects (be they taxa or specimens)
that are grouped together as "characters."  We use "states" to describe
items.  However, Special States aren't observable and aren't used to
describe items.

What are "Special States"?  They are a mix of two separate sets of
information.  They document the status of data coding (for example
"unknown", "not interpretable" and "unfinished work") and they document
application-specific business rules (for example "use character default
state" - get the data based on a flag set for a specific state of this
character).  These are fundamentally different things and show the
danger of mixing data, business practices and application development.

Lack of appreciation for these differences as resulted in "use default"
being treated as a case of "data have not yet been entered" when in fact
a state has been clearly indicated (through a pointer): it's the default
state (however the data or application defines this) and is certainly
known.  It's a user-interface shortcut used by an application to make
data entry quicker (in the opinion of an application developer!).  The
end result is exactly the same as if the state had been entered directly
in the description (the taxon by character intersection, or what DELTA
calls the Attribute).

This thinking results in some very complex processing being required by
consumers of SDD documents.  For example, it is suggested that if a
description is null, then the "special state" called "use default"
should be inserted and that this "state" be set to "not yet evaluated."
This means that to interpret an SDD document you not only have to
understand the individual data items but also know the rules for
processing them (to know that if data is missing you need to insert a
special value and then look this value up in another list to translate
it into something meaningful).  There must be a cleaner way to do this!

The "unknown", "not interpretable" and similar "special states" are
another problem altogether.  These "states" have nothing to do with
characters and everything to do with descriptions.  This is why Mike
Dallwitz didn't include them as part of the Character List.  I can
understand why you might want to treat these as "states" of characters
as this is the basic DELTA paradigm.  However, there is no need to do
this and doing so only complicates things.  For example, to tell if a
description has not been coded you'll need to get its state(s) and then
check their translations to see if any are "unknown", "not
interpretable" or any one of who knows how many other special
conditions.

A much better way to implement this functionality would be to store an
"uncoded" flag with the description along with an (encoded or
text-based) explanation ("unknown", "not interpretable", "too lazy to
code this", "don't have proper specimens", "To Do" or what ever).  This
is both direct and allows the explanation to change in a simple and
flexible way.

These are the most serious and fundamental problems I have with the
current document.  I would also add the following minor comments (some
of these expand on the above comments as well).

The meaning of the DELTA "U" in attributes:  It's stated in the document
that this means "attempts to research the information were made but
failed" and that "the state U in DELTA is also used for cases where data
are present, but the author is unable to interpret them in current
terminology."  The DELTA documentation states simply that "A missing
attribute is equivalent to an attribute with pseudo-value U" and that
"If the state of the character is unknown, then the character is
omitted, or the state value coded as U."  I can't find anything in the
DELTA documentation that gives a reason for the use of U or suggests
that "attempts to research the information were made but failed" or
anything similar.  It would seem that DELTA treats nulls and U as the
same, nothing more.

Remove all sections dealing with "performance", "user-interfaces" and
referring to "applications."  These deal with specific software
developments and should not influence the SDD standard.

Great care should be taken when developing "business rules" for
interpreting an SDD document.  For example see the discussion starting
with "One frequent situation is that characters are added to the
terminology.  Possible solutions to achieve a synchronization between
descriptions and a separate terminology in this case are:".  It may be
important for SDD to document this situation but HOW it is dealt with is
up to individual applications and has little to do with the data itself
(which is the focus of SDD).  The same problem occurs with the statement
"The omission of character coding in a description should be used to
express the "use default" state."  This mixes data with processing.  The
lack of data is simply that - it implies nothing more and NO assumptions
should be made about it.  If the default state should be used then the
author needs to state this.

What does "terminology" mean?  It seems to be the character/character
state list but this is unclear.  It might be good to develop a glossary
of terms so we all know what we're talking about.

We also need to define "schema."  My understanding is that a "schema" is
a model of the structure of the data and not the data itself.  If you
add data you don't change the schema (assuming that this addition is
permitted by the schema - it's like adding rows to a database table -
the schema doesn't change, only the data).  But at several points the
document says "... the case that the terminology is changing ("schema
evolution") is ..." or similar.  This sounds like changes to the data
change the schema.  Is this the general view of schema or am I on the
wrong track?

The section discussing "Data have not yet been entered", "Data cannot be
entered" and "Data could have been entered but a deliberate decision was
made not to enter them" seems to mix unrelated cases and is a mess.  The
options listed are (followed by my interpretation of their meaning):
1) "Use character default state": Data is coded and is not missing (see
above).
2) "Unfinished work": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
3) "Not applicable": Data does not logically exist.
4) "Unknown": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
5) "Not interpretable": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
6) "Out of scope": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
7) "Do not need to score": Data is coded and is not missing.
The mix involves data that is being pointed to through a process (No. 1
and 7), data that is impossible to collect (No. 3) and data that can be
collected but hasn't (for a variety of reasons) (No. 2, 4, 5 and 6).
Keep it simple by recording if data is absent and if it is, the reason.
Don't confuse it with application-specific short cuts ("Use default",
"Inherit/Compile from Parent/Children") or personal decisions made by an
author ("it's too hard to code", "this character is unimportant here",
"appropriate specimens are unavailable", etc).  These are distinct
cases.

There are a number of cases where attempts are made to develop lists of
conditions or situations.  For example, it is asked "Should a general
'cannot score' (for any kind of reason) be differentiated into" and then
three situations are listed.  Again, generalise this into "uncoded" with
a text-based explanation ("observation method failed", "incomplete
specimen" or any one of a thousand other reasons).  All the information
is captured and the system is rich enough to handle unforseen
situations.  This approach also fits perfectly with the previous
example.

There is a note that "a general method is planned (@but not yet
formalized!@) in SDD" and that "SDD is considering introducing computed
characters."  We've been at this for at least 2 years now and there are
things that are "planned" or are "being considered" for SDD that we
don't know about?!?!?  Or is there an overall planning document that I'm
not aware of?  WE are SDD, SDD can't be "considering" things in
isolation.

The entire discussion of inheritance and compilation (or what ever we
call it) needs to be though of in a fresh light.  Again, the document
confuses data with process.  For example, it's stated that "it is
desirable that the assumption [of inheritance/compilation] rather than
the inherited data are recorded".  The author of the dataset MUST
present real data, not give a process to get to that data.  Yes, the
author can tell us how they collected the data ("inherited from direct
parent", "compiled using Gouldes Statistic from all coded children", "by
reference to the default state for this character") but they also must
give us the data, not make us go look for it.  The process of
inheritance/compilation is too complex to leave to chance and trying to
define exactly what it means is too error prone.  I would suggest that
inheritance/compilation is an application-based activity, not a
fundamental aspect of the data.  Again, give us the data and separately
tell us how it was derived, don't make us derive it ourselves.

This exact same problem exists with "computed data."  I don't see how or
why an SDD document can contain the value "CouldNotCompute" because the
"generator couldn't compute this".  The "generator" is a piece of
software, not a data representation (which is what SDD is).
"CouldNotCompute" is an error message returned from an application and
it should never end up in an SDD document.  Yet again, if you want to
explain how the data was generated, find, do it, but don't make us
calculate it, we don't know how.

The discussion about "Not supported as special states, but supported
through modifiers" is good but, as above, describes descriptions and not
characters.  That's why inheritance/compilation is included here.

The statement "Special states express knowledge about why data for a
given character are missing in a description and thus make a statement
about the entire character" is interesting.  It says that special states
are about a character in a description.  The point I would make is that
they are primarily about the description, not the character.  They say
nothing about the character's use for other items, and only relate to
this character in this taxon, and this is through the "description."  So
let's focus this document on the description and only discuss the
character when it's appropriate.  This is supported by the statement
that "DELTA does not define the special states in the "character list"
directive: they are implicitly present in each character."  They are not
in the character list because the have little to do with characters.
They are in the DELTA attributes because they have everything to do with
descriptions.  I'm sorry to say that the next statement shows the danger
of letting past developments influence current work (and I'm as guilty
as any): "When a new character is created, DeltaAccess automatically
creates the full set of special states."  In BioLink we attach this
information to the description: you do it when you're coding the data,
not developing the character list.  I don't know which way is better and
as noted above, it probably doesn't matter as each application will
translate the information into a local format anyway.  What we DO need
to do is make sure the SDD format is expressive, flexible and as
application-neutral as possible (and ideally simple).

Most of the discussion under "Relations between declarative character
dependency and special states" seems to deal with developing
applications rather than data representation and may well be outside
SDD.  Sure, document that these dependencies exist and use them to
produce high-quality and internally consistent data, but do this at
application-level, not SDD-level.

The same applies to "Responsibility for validation."  SDD should be
about representing data in a standardized way, not about enforcing
taxonomic business rules or data quality standards.  As SDD will be
represented in XML then this XML document must be well-formed and pass a
check with a DTD or XML-Schema checker.  But SDD shouldn't be
responsible for checking the content of individual data items, that's
the job of authors and their applications.


********************************************************

So, to summarize:

SDD is about data and only data.  These data include characters and
descriptions and (optionally) how these descriptions were developed and
their current status.

SDD is not about process.  Process information can be included but it is
optional and can be safely ignored without data loss.  [I shouldn't have
to process a "use default data" statement to access a complete
description, the appropriate state(s) should be inserted into the
description when the SDD document is prepared with a note on how it was
derived.]

SDD is not about applications.  Discussions concerning user-interfaces
or processing methods should not be included.  [How an application
manages and represents these data is completely independent of how SDD
represents the data.]


********************************

Finally, I want to reconfirm that Gregor has done a fantastic job with
getting us this far and I support his efforts.  My comments are more
about a different perspective rather than any serious flaw in logic.
Most of what is in the document is well presented and relevant to
managing taxonomic descriptions, I'm just not sure it is directly
related to the goals of SDD.

And sorry for going on for so long.  I'll sit down now.

You need to manually append the "l" (so that the URL ends in ".html",
instead of ".htm").

The "l" was forced onto the next line in Steve's original message.

Kevin,

It's not just you. The URL Steve provided was not quite correct - the

Hi All,

I've had a look at the excellent "Special States" document
(http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/Docs/SDD_P_Data_SpecialStates.htm
l) put together by Gregor and a few comments are attached below.

These comments are in several sections (with a few notes at the bottom).
Have a look at the first and last sections and the long second section
if you are expecially interested.  This second section is pretty long
and rambles a bit, but covers a wide range of issues centred on Gregor's
document.  Hopefully it will help move the SDD forward.

Thanks, Steve

******************************************************************

SDD Special States

At some level the details of the SDD structure are less important than
its content.  This is because few (if any) consuming applications will
use SDD other than as a source of information, this information being
translated into application-specific formats for processing and
analysis.  This requires mapping SDD items to local items and this can
be done for any given SDD structure.

Taking this approach, I would make only one suggestion: generalize,
Generalize, GENERALIZE!  What I mean is that the current Special States
document attempts to define all of the possible Special States that are
to be part of SDD and even goes so far as to exclude some potential
Special States.  I would strongly suggest that SDD have a general method
for handling these, with at most a list of suggested Special States
rather than trying to be too restrictive.  I firmly believe that it will
be extremely difficult (and short sighted) to try to define these as
part of the SDD Standard.  The list of useful Special States is much
longer than the few suggested in the current document, and an extension
is even suggested at the end of the document, a "ToDo" Special State.
Many more can be thought of with little effort.

This same difficulty (trying to be too specific) has arisen in related
activities within TDWG and has resulted in an unfortunate split among
participants.  There are two camps within the specimen-based standards
group, one arguing for a complete description of specimens, the other
looking for a set of common items across most groups.  The first group
has developed a "standard" with some 400 items while the second has
selected in the neighbourhood of 20 or so items.  My impression is that
SDD is taking the first approach: study the problem long enough and the
entire universe of data items and their relationships can be documented.
I'm not confident this is possible.  Biology is too diverse and needs
change too quickly to document all of life in any stable, meaningful and
useful way.  We can provide a framework and make suggestions, but we
won't be successful if we try to dictate too narrowly.

So my suggestion is that we focus on general needs, such as support for
Special States, but that we don't try to define other than at most a few
basic data items (such as general Special States).  What we provide is a
mechanism to support this functionality with the ability to extend it in
a controlled and flexible way.


****************************************************

OK, this is where it gets ugly.  I have a few specific comments on the
current Special States document, some relating to general issues, some
to specific comments.  These are less important than the message above
and largely represent a slightly different perspective on SDD from the
one given in the current document.

First, the scope of SDD.  Currently SDD is trying to address three
separate and non-overlapping issues: (1) data, (2) business practices
and (3) application development.  Data is the specific information items
under consideration, business practices are how we think of this items
and how we handle them, and applications are specific pieces of software
used by manage data items.  The current Special States document mixes
these three areas, talking about data items, how people interpreter them
and how they might be displayed by a computer program.  The first area
is clearly within the scope of SDD, the second possibly but only in a
very general, non-specific way, and the third is clearly outside SDD
(and well it should be).  Bob made essentially this same comment when he
said that he thought "project management problems were not part of SDD."
We need to focus on DATA and nothing more.

The second serious problem I have with Special States is that they
aren't "states" in the normal, taxonomic sense.  Taxonomic "states" are
observations made about biological objects (be they taxa or specimens)
that are grouped together as "characters."  We use "states" to describe
items.  However, Special States aren't observable and aren't used to
describe items.

What are "Special States"?  They are a mix of two separate sets of
information.  They document the status of data coding (for example
"unknown", "not interpretable" and "unfinished work") and they document
application-specific business rules (for example "use character default
state" - get the data based on a flag set for a specific state of this
character).  These are fundamentally different things and show the
danger of mixing data, business practices and application development.

Lack of appreciation for these differences as resulted in "use default"
being treated as a case of "data have not yet been entered" when in fact
a state has been clearly indicated (through a pointer): it's the default
state (however the data or application defines this) and is certainly
known.  It's a user-interface shortcut used by an application to make
data entry quicker (in the opinion of an application developer!).  The
end result is exactly the same as if the state had been entered directly
in the description (the taxon by character intersection, or what DELTA
calls the Attribute).

This thinking results in some very complex processing being required by
consumers of SDD documents.  For example, it is suggested that if a
description is null, then the "special state" called "use default"
should be inserted and that this "state" be set to "not yet evaluated."
This means that to interpret an SDD document you not only have to
understand the individual data items but also know the rules for
processing them (to know that if data is missing you need to insert a
special value and then look this value up in another list to translate
it into something meaningful).  There must be a cleaner way to do this!

The "unknown", "not interpretable" and similar "special states" are
another problem altogether.  These "states" have nothing to do with
characters and everything to do with descriptions.  This is why Mike
Dallwitz didn't include them as part of the Character List.  I can
understand why you might want to treat these as "states" of characters
as this is the basic DELTA paradigm.  However, there is no need to do
this and doing so only complicates things.  For example, to tell if a
description has not been coded you'll need to get its state(s) and then
check their translations to see if any are "unknown", "not
interpretable" or any one of who knows how many other special
conditions.

A much better way to implement this functionality would be to store an
"uncoded" flag with the description along with an (encoded or
text-based) explanation ("unknown", "not interpretable", "too lazy to
code this", "don't have proper specimens", "To Do" or what ever).  This
is both direct and allows the explanation to change in a simple and
flexible way.

These are the most serious and fundamental problems I have with the
current document.  I would also add the following minor comments (some
of these expand on the above comments as well).

The meaning of the DELTA "U" in attributes:  It's stated in the document
that this means "attempts to research the information were made but
failed" and that "the state U in DELTA is also used for cases where data
are present, but the author is unable to interpret them in current
terminology."  The DELTA documentation states simply that "A missing
attribute is equivalent to an attribute with pseudo-value U" and that
"If the state of the character is unknown, then the character is
omitted, or the state value coded as U."  I can't find anything in the
DELTA documentation that gives a reason for the use of U or suggests
that "attempts to research the information were made but failed" or
anything similar.  It would seem that DELTA treats nulls and U as the
same, nothing more.

Remove all sections dealing with "performance", "user-interfaces" and
referring to "applications."  These deal with specific software
developments and should not influence the SDD standard.

Great care should be taken when developing "business rules" for
interpreting an SDD document.  For example see the discussion starting
with "One frequent situation is that characters are added to the
terminology.  Possible solutions to achieve a synchronization between
descriptions and a separate terminology in this case are:".  It may be
important for SDD to document this situation but HOW it is dealt with is
up to individual applications and has little to do with the data itself
(which is the focus of SDD).  The same problem occurs with the statement
"The omission of character coding in a description should be used to
express the "use default" state."  This mixes data with processing.  The
lack of data is simply that - it implies nothing more and NO assumptions
should be made about it.  If the default state should be used then the
author needs to state this.

What does "terminology" mean?  It seems to be the character/character
state list but this is unclear.  It might be good to develop a glossary
of terms so we all know what we're talking about.

We also need to define "schema."  My understanding is that a "schema" is
a model of the structure of the data and not the data itself.  If you
add data you don't change the schema (assuming that this addition is
permitted by the schema - it's like adding rows to a database table -
the schema doesn't change, only the data).  But at several points the
document says "... the case that the terminology is changing ("schema
evolution") is ..." or similar.  This sounds like changes to the data
change the schema.  Is this the general view of schema or am I on the
wrong track?

The section discussing "Data have not yet been entered", "Data cannot be
entered" and "Data could have been entered but a deliberate decision was
made not to enter them" seems to mix unrelated cases and is a mess.  The
options listed are (followed by my interpretation of their meaning):
1) "Use character default state": Data is coded and is not missing (see
above).
2) "Unfinished work": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
3) "Not applicable": Data does not logically exist.
4) "Unknown": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
5) "Not interpretable": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
6) "Out of scope": Data exists but has yet to be captured.
7) "Do not need to score": Data is coded and is not missing.
The mix involves data that is being pointed to through a process (No. 1
and 7), data that is impossible to collect (No. 3) and data that can be
collected but hasn't (for a variety of reasons) (No. 2, 4, 5 and 6).
Keep it simple by recording if data is absent and if it is, the reason.
Don't confuse it with application-specific short cuts ("Use default",
"Inherit/Compile from Parent/Children") or personal decisions made by an
author ("it's too hard to code", "this character is unimportant here",
"appropriate specimens are unavailable", etc).  These are distinct
cases.

There are a number of cases where attempts are made to develop lists of
conditions or situations.  For example, it is asked "Should a general
'cannot score' (for any kind of reason) be differentiated into" and then
three situations are listed.  Again, generalise this into "uncoded" with
a text-based explanation ("observation method failed", "incomplete
specimen" or any one of a thousand other reasons).  All the information
is captured and the system is rich enough to handle unforseen
situations.  This approach also fits perfectly with the previous
example.

There is a note that "a general method is planned (@but not yet
formalized!@) in SDD" and that "SDD is considering introducing computed
characters."  We've been at this for at least 2 years now and there are
things that are "planned" or are "being considered" for SDD that we
don't know about?!?!?  Or is there an overall planning document that I'm
not aware of?  WE are SDD, SDD can't be "considering" things in
isolation.

The entire discussion of inheritance and compilation (or what ever we
call it) needs to be though of in a fresh light.  Again, the document
confuses data with process.  For example, it's stated that "it is
desirable that the assumption [of inheritance/compilation] rather than
the inherited data are recorded".  The author of the dataset MUST
present real data, not give a process to get to that data.  Yes, the
author can tell us how they collected the data ("inherited from direct
parent", "compiled using Gouldes Statistic from all coded children", "by
reference to the default state for this character") but they also must
give us the data, not make us go look for it.  The process of
inheritance/compilation is too complex to leave to chance and trying to
define exactly what it means is too error prone.  I would suggest that
inheritance/compilation is an application-based activity, not a
fundamental aspect of the data.  Again, give us the data and separately
tell us how it was derived, don't make us derive it ourselves.

This exact same problem exists with "computed data."  I don't see how or
why an SDD document can contain the value "CouldNotCompute" because the
"generator couldn't compute this".  The "generator" is a piece of
software, not a data representation (which is what SDD is).
"CouldNotCompute" is an error message returned from an application and
it should never end up in an SDD document.  Yet again, if you want to
explain how the data was generated, find, do it, but don't make us
calculate it, we don't know how.

The discussion about "Not supported as special states, but supported
through modifiers" is good but, as above, describes descriptions and not
characters.  That's why inheritance/compilation is included here.

The statement "Special states express knowledge about why data for a
given character are missing in a description and thus make a statement
about the entire character" is interesting.  It says that special states
are about a character in a description.  The point I would make is that
they are primarily about the description, not the character.  They say
nothing about the character's use for other items, and only relate to
this character in this taxon, and this is through the "description."  So
let's focus this document on the description and only discuss the
character when it's appropriate.  This is supported by the statement
that "DELTA does not define the special states in the "character list"
directive: they are implicitly present in each character."  They are not
in the character list because the have little to do with characters.
They are in the DELTA attributes because they have everything to do with
descriptions.  I'm sorry to say that the next statement shows the danger
of letting past developments influence current work (and I'm as guilty
as any): "When a new character is created, DeltaAccess automatically
creates the full set of special states."  In BioLink we attach this
information to the description: you do it when you're coding the data,
not developing the character list.  I don't know which way is better and
as noted above, it probably doesn't matter as each application will
translate the information into a local format anyway.  What we DO need
to do is make sure the SDD format is expressive, flexible and as
application-neutral as possible (and ideally simple).

Most of the discussion under "Relations between declarative character
dependency and special states" seems to deal with developing
applications rather than data representation and may well be outside
SDD.  Sure, document that these dependencies exist and use them to
produce high-quality and internally consistent data, but do this at
application-level, not SDD-level.

The same applies to "Responsibility for validation."  SDD should be
about representing data in a standardized way, not about enforcing
taxonomic business rules or data quality standards.  As SDD will be
represented in XML then this XML document must be well-formed and pass a
check with a DTD or XML-Schema checker.  But SDD shouldn't be
responsible for checking the content of individual data items, that's
the job of authors and their applications.


********************************************************

So, to summarize:

SDD is about data and only data.  These data include characters and
descriptions and (optionally) how these descriptions were developed and
their current status.

SDD is not about process.  Process information can be included but it is
optional and can be safely ignored without data loss.  [I shouldn't have
to process a "use default data" statement to access a complete
description, the appropriate state(s) should be inserted into the
description when the SDD document is prepared with a note on how it was
derived.]

SDD is not about applications.  Discussions concerning user-interfaces
or processing methods should not be included.  [How an application
manages and represents these data is completely independent of how SDD
represents the data.]


********************************

Finally, I want to reconfirm that Gregor has done a fantastic job with
getting us this far and I support his efforts.  My comments are more
about a different perspective rather than any serious flaw in logic.
Most of what is in the document is well presented and relevant to
managing taxonomic descriptions, I'm just not sure it is directly
related to the goals of SDD.

And sorry for going on for so long.  I'll sit down now.

Steve Shattuck's response to Gregor's Special States document raises some
important points. There is a clear divergence of opinion as to the role and
scope of SDD. It seems to me that the difference is that Steve wants SDD to
record pure descriptive facts, while Gregor wants it to capture a scientific
work-in-progress, including the judgements and process decisions of the
scientist. Hence, Gregor wants SDD to capture the types of statements that a
taxonomist may wish to make with respect to an evolving description (in this
case, with respect to uncertainty or missing data in the description), while
Steve is sticking with the pure known, that the data are missing so lets
leave it at that. Am I right, you two?

Steve regards that there is a potentially infinite universe of possibly
useful special states. In this view, any attempt to specify a few special
states is restrictive, so we need to generalize, Generalize, GENERALIZE.
Steve's suggestion is:

| A much better way to implement this functionality would be to store an
| "uncoded" flag with the description along with an (encoded or
| text-based) explanation ("unknown", "not interpretable", "too lazy to
| code this", "don't have proper specimens", "To Do" or what ever).  This
| is both direct and allows the explanation to change in a simple and
| flexible way.

It seems to me that if the "explanation" is encoded, then this suggestion is
not a long way from Gregor's. If the "explanation" is text-based, then it
will be a mere comment that may be useful to the original author but will be
impossible to process by any other application. I agree that processing
issues need to be kept firmly under control in SDD but I don't think they
have no role - after all, we're capturing these data in order to process
them, not just archive them.

Under Gregor's model and Steve's "encoded explanation" model, we would need
to be quite sure that it is possible to capture the entire universe of
statements describing the uncertainty. This seems to me to be possible. For
instance, the following list of possibilities for an unencoded datum seem to
be exhaustive:

It's logically possible to code and I intend to code it but haven't gotten
around to it yet (unfinished business)
It's logically possible to code and I intend not to do it (character scoped
out)
It's logically impossible to code (inapplicable)

Surely there's no space between the logically possible and logically
impossible, or between the intend to do it and intend not to do it. (There
may of course be subcategories of these that we may choose to capture. And
there will of course be a role for free-form text)

I agree with Steve (and Gregor) that Gregor's document is messy and we need
to clean up and tease out the concepts.

Cheers - k

Comment on Gregor's Special States document.

Gregor writes: "All these special states apply to entire characters. SDD
currently provides no mechanism to express partial knowledge within a
character (e. g. to score one state as not applicable, but another as
present). Theoretically it is possible that a character is only partly
entered, but this is not likely in a well designed terminology (it does
happen where character clusters are combined into pseudo-characters, but
such a design is considered problematic)."

Not so. One important difference between Lucid and DELTA is that DELTA can
only encode uncertainty for a whole character, Lucid only for a character
state. Often in Lucid we do encode uncertainty for an entire character (for
example, fruit colour is uncertain for a given taxon because fruits are
unknown) - we do this by (slightly messily) encoding uncertainty for all the
states of the character:

Fruit colour (coding for taxon x)
    red - UNCERTAIN
    yellow - UNCERTAIN
    pink - UNCERTAIN
    white - UNCERTAIN
        ....etc

In other circumstances, we encode certainty data for some states of a
character, uncertain for others:

Distribution by States within Australia (coding for taxon x)
    Victoria - ABSENT
    New South Wales - PRESENT
    Queensland - PRESENT
    Northern Territory -UNCERTAIN
    Western Australia - PRESENT
    South Australia -ABSENT
    Tasmania -ABSENT

This is real coding for a taxon that has been collected in rainforests in
northern New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. It has not been
recorded in the Northern Territory, although suitable rainforests occur
there and it may well be found there. I'm confident that it does not occur
in the other states.

Right. This may be a better base hierachy than the one in the first

Yes. Whether special states can bear comment or not has not yet been
discussed.

I agree again. The first version was really sitting between the
chairs, in being minutes of a lengthy discussion in Brazil, and
starting to reorganize and add to the thoughts.

I am grateful for the criticism and the thoughts you guys put into
this!

Regarding Uncertainty: I propose to use modifiers on states for this
purpose (see the chapter in Special states: "Not supported as special
state, but supported through modifiers" and the linked document on
"Uncertainty modifiers"). That is, Uncertainty is NOT a special state
as discussed in the paragraph quoted at the start.

The question is: Is it necessary to code "unfinished work" or "not
applicable" against states? This is not a trivial decision. Making
Unknown/not applicable statements realtive to states means that any
change in the state terminology requires a revision of all
descriptions using that character. If the character is a true atomic
entity, I believe it is easier to enforce that these statements are
character level statements, not modifiers.

I believe that the attempts to use "unfinished work" or "not
applicable" usually show we are dealing with "pseudo-characters" like
distribution. Does anybody have a good case with real descriptive,
chemical or morphological data? Stuff like "enzyme tests" I really
consider an assemblage of characters, which will be much less painful
to handle appropriately as soon as character groups and hierarchy are
present. Currently people like to keep these in one character,
because that is the only hierarchy readily available for organizing
the work.

Thanks to both Kevin and Gregor for the comments on my comments.

Kevin is pretty much right that I see the main use of SDD as documenting
essentially finished data rather than a "work in progress".  My thinking
is that most people will work on their dataset until it's finished, then
make it available through SDD to other interested parties.  My
assumption is that most collaborative projects will select a single tool
to use while building the dataset (be it DELTA, LucID, DeltaAccess or
what ever) and will use the native format of this application to share
data. =20

Now, I have no problem with capturing details needed by specific
situations or applications and would say that these are important and
should be support by SDD.  However, I would try to make them extensions
to the basic, core data rather than part of the core itself. =20

The fundamental problem I see is making SDD truly extensible and yet
generic at the same time.  The big problem with the DELTA standard is
that every time Mike needed new DELTA program functionality he extended
the DELTA standard by adding new directives.  This meant that if you
wanted to support the DELTA standard you needed to follow Mike's lead.
It's hardly a "standard" if it's being pushed by one group.

A specific example - "Use default state."  We are looking hard at this
in BioLink and will probably stay away from it, using different
functionality to achieve the same thing (rapid data entry and global
data changes).   We obviously support this when importing from DELTA
(and possibly from SDD) but it won't be core functionality for us and we
won't export it.  To enshrine this in SDD simply because DELTA had it
(or some other application currently supports it) may not be the best
approach (it may be, but I'm not willing to make that assumption unless
we have to).

The same seems to be true for describing uncertainty.  Kevin suggests
that there are only three "special states":

It's logically possible to code and I intend to code it but haven't
gotten around to it yet (unfinished business)=20
It's logically possible to code and I intend not to do it (character
scoped out) It's logically impossible to code (inapplicable)

I only see two here:

It's logically possible to code but I haven't done it
It's logically impossible to code

PLUS a reason:

unfinished business
character scoped out
don't have specimens
+ a thousand other reasons.

To overcome the "machine processing" problem you'll need to enumerate
this list and that's fine.  But don't build a structure that makes it
hard to change that enumeration at any time or as any set of users sees
fit.  The problem with "special states" is that it overloads "states",
which have nothing to do with the uncertainty of the data. =20

I think this is a priority issue.  It is FAR more important to know if
this character has been scored for this taxon than to know the reason
why it was or wasn't.  If you want to then tell me the reason, great.
But keep it simple and flexible.  It also separates data from metadata
along slightly different lines.  I consider the state to be data, the
reason for coding/not coding to be metadata and want to separate these
as much as possible.

Kevin's discussion of attaching uncertainly to states breaks Gregor's
SDD model in more fundamentally than what I had proposed.  As Gregor
suggests, this would  result in fundamental changes to the current SDD
model.  The use of "modifiers" might work, but again, they are fairly
tightly associated with natural language representation (as I understand
it) and may not generalize well to fulfil Kevin's needs.

This leads to two thoughts:

First, it is crucial for SDD to be the product of a team with differing
views who work together towards some middle ground.  Otherwise it is
unlikely that it will meet the needs of the broader community.

Second, I worry about SDD becoming too specialised and too complex.  The
"joy" of the DELTA standard is its simplicity.  And this simplicity is,
I would say, one of the reasons it has been so successful.  I would
contrast this with the Nexus format.  Nexus is only seriously being used
by the 3 or 4 applications involved in its original development.  It is
hardly a "standard" outside this small community.  The power of Nexus is
that it supports essentially all of the features of these original
applications.  This seems to be the way SDD is heading: support all of
the features of character-based programs that currently exist.  My
concern would be that if we do this we will be the only people who use
SDD, new players finding the format so complex and so specialised that
it's expensive to implement and has little flexibility to support
"extensions" outside of the strict standard.  If this is true and is
realised we all lose.

Hi there,

I'm new to this group and was envolved with DELTA writing my TAXASOFT
programs years ago. I agree that there was some mixture between the DELTA
standard and special needs (directives) for the programs using it, which
was a wrong choice (discussed these polutions with Mike years ago, to keep
the chars, items and specs file free from this).

The power of DELTA is its simple flat format and I agree that the new
format must be as simple and transparant as possible.

I do not know in what stage this SDD devellopment is, but I'm highly
interested in a DELTA like format that is XML based (done a lot with XML
lately) to provide hirarchical features in the items part.

Hello,

my apologies to all list members for dropping out of the discussion
for almost 5 months. I was overwhelmed with other work and could not
get out of just feeling guilty but not picking the work up again. I
am back from other work and also just back from vacation.

I agree with your concern about complexity. It already shows that the
complexity present is difficult to document. We urgently need more
introductory material.

However, I disagree about the notion of "finished datasets". I may be
wrong, but I think that this is a thing of the past. The current
process of publishing scientific information in unchangeable batches
is primarily a function of the process of publishing printed
materials, which are difficult to revise. I believe in the future we
will move into continuously updated and revised versions. The
granularity in terms of time may be months or years, but not decades
as it is currently the case.

Especially when I am thinking about collaboration I am thinking not
about 2 or 3 people working closely, but a loose network of
collaborators. That also includes that datasets are passed on from
one generation to the next. If some researcher created a very
valuable dataset as a finished work, then retired and a new Ph.D.
candidate revises this dataset, it will be irrelevant whether
creation and intellectual property details are in the SDD set.
However, the outcome of this will be a dataset perhaps 5% improved,
95% original material. Now I believe it is undesirable to pass the
entire dataset on to the next reviser without any indication of what
happened. In this second step, I believe it is the task of the SDD
exchange format to record some fundamental attribution of
intellectual property.

I am, however receptive to wisdom that caring for this (web updated
data etc.) makes our task too complicated.

Here I would maintain that we do you existing programs to help us in
finding the requirements, but that the presence of a feature in a
program never had any bearing on whether it should become a feature
of SDD. Rather the argument always is: Is there a need to exchange
such data, do these data describe scientific information or
management information that should be interoperable as metadata of
the scientific process. Quite a number of DeltaAccess features are
NOT or completely differently supported in SDD.

The concern about complexity is correct, however.

A call to everyone: Please do join the TDWD /SDD meeting in Lisbon,
21-26 October of this year, to help us finding a good compromise!

(Please inform me by direct mail if you are likely to come)

This is a part we have purposely excluded in the discussions in
Brazil and Paris so far, and perhaps it is time to open a discussion
about this on the list. The answer to this discussion looms in the
background of the current SDD outline, since it may cause major
structural rearrangments. I therefore believe it important that we
deal with it.

The reason for not taking on the object hierarchy of the described
items is that it has two aspects:

1. Fundamental evolutionary hierarchy = taxonomic systematics
  -> in my opinion it is not the purpose of a descriptive
     data standard to cover this. The hierarchisation of taxa into
     an evolutionary tree is a complex and contentious process that
     is independent of the fundamental data that are being observed
     (rather than implied by the taxonomic hierarchy)
  -> just like taxon concepts, obligate and facultative synonymy, the
     the hierarchisation of taxa should be covered by a separate
     taxonomic standard.
  -> to produce complete Flora/Fauna treatments, these standards need
     to work together.
  -> Note that a new TDWG "Taxonomic Names" xml standards group has
     been formed. The convener is Jerry Cooper and it will meet
     the first time at the TDWG meeting in Portugal

2. However, several aspects of complex descriptive data sets need
   an operational access to a taxonomic hierarchy.
   -> default values for new items
   -> observations assumed to be true for an entire group but not
      actually observed should be noted as "higher taxa" descriptions
      and the information should be treated as implied in lower taxa.
      The situation is identical for implying information from
      species to subspecies as it is from Family to species.
      -> Note that in contrast to DELTA, SDD has no special
         "subspecies mechanism"
   -> scoping characters in/out for specific groups. Scoping means
      that characters are only applicable or desirable to code only
      in certain groups (in contrast to character dependency, which
      is a reflexive relationship within descriptive data)

(What other data or features depend on the taxon hierarchy? Can
anybody provide good discussion examples?)

So, I have no good solution for this. One option would be to simply
allow any operational hierarchization in SDD and not care about
taxonomic codes, standards, etc. at all, only providing a linking
mechanism to taxonomic data sets. Is that desirable?

Steve Shattuck in March responded with a long and detailed criticism
of my Special States proposal/Brazil minutes mix, for which I am very
grateful. I currently try to revise the information.

One important point Steve raised was that the term "Special States"
is very confusing because, although they are documenting knowledge
management metadata in the object description, they are not
terminological states in the character definition.

I was never happy with "special states", but neither in Brazil nor in
Paris we found a better name. The current options are:

<li>Management states (not "internal" data management)</li>
<li>Data scoring</li>
<li>Status states</li>
<li>Status flag</li>
<li>Data entry status</li>
<li>Control states</li>
<li>Special states</li>
<li>Completeness states</li>
<li>Incompleteness states</li>
<li>Completion states</li>
<li>Pseudo character values (used e.&nbsp;g. by L.&nbsp;Dodds in
XDELTA proposal)</li>
<li>Replacement values</li>
<li>Meta states ("meta ..." was considered too unspecific, being only
a relative statement)</li>
<li>Missing data indicators</li>
<li>Missing data flags</li>
<li>Null states</li>
<li>Null values</li>

"Data entry status flags" seems appropriate, but awfully long.

"Knowledge management state" seems to be a bit too general, because
it is only part of Kn.man.

"Missing data flags"  can easily be misunderstood as "missing data-
flags" rather than "missing-data flags"


Has anybody a bright idea?

Just some thoughts:

I think a transparent mechanism is needed in which you can indicate in the
item description which rank a taxon (item) is and you can include as many
taxon ranks as you like (the subspecies mechanism is included then).
Taxa can link to higher (and maybe lower) taxa, so the program that is
going to produce Natural Language Descriptions can include descriptive
characters from several ranks (as indicated by the user). Identification
programs can start at a chosen rank and continue to the next rank taxa when
finished. In XML this would be easy to define.

In this way you could key out specimen for a whole family or flora when
included, from family to subforma level if you like.

It's good to see you back Gregor, most welcome.

For "Special States", another way to look at it is that this doesn't
really relate to a character but to the coding of a given character for
a given taxon.  It is really the status of the coding of that character
for a taxon.  Instead of storing it as a part of the character (by
creating a new state for the character) why not create a new element for
this information and attach it to the taxon by character intersection
(or "cell", or "taxon description").  Call it "Coding Status" with an
enumerated list of "Coded" (meaning the taxon has been coded for this
character), "Not yet coded" (meaning it will be coded when I get around
to it), "Not to be coded" (meaning it can be coded but I not going to)
and "Can't be coded".  Then add a text attribute to this element to
allow an explanation of what's going on for the coding of this character
for this taxon ("I haven't yet coded this character because suitable
material of this taxon is currently unavailable").  This would seem to
meet the needs of computer processing (through a defined,
machine-readable enumerated list), extensibility (by supporting
additions to this list such as "Coded but unreliable") and a full,
human-readable explanation of what's going on (in the text comment).

I think this "problem" is directly related to a number of issues I
raised in early March and Kevin expanded on in his email of 21 March.
Until those issues are addressed I don't think we'll make any real
progress and we will continue to be distracted by the detail while the
bigger picture and ultimate goals of this project are overlooked.

We need to take a step back before we can move forward.

Thanks, Steve

I agree on the need to add an option for annotation text and to keep
the "coding status/missing data indicator" list relatively short.

I also can basically accept your list, except that the last example
usually applies to a coded state, not the character, i.e. one state
may be coded unreliably, the other ok. Currently we propose to use
uncertainty modifiers (probably, perhaps, etc.) for this case. This
is similar to the "by-misinterpretation" mechanism originally
proposed by Kevin, now proposed in SDD to be handled through a coding
modifier on an existing state.

General question to all: Any examples where having
uncertainty/unreliability should apply to the entire character rather
than to the states, i.e. where if implemented as a modifier this
would always have to be added to all states?

I wonder whether the "Coded" option is redundant. This should be
evident if no other CodingStatus is present and data are coded.
Except for redundancy (and therefore the need to enforce a rule that
"Coded" requires categorical or numerical data to be indeed coded;
else it would be a "lie"), I have no problem with it.

> We need to take a step back before we can move forward.

I am quite willing to take that step back. Let my try to explain the
reasoning why I think it is a good idea to generalize "coding
status/missing data indicators" to be handled akin to categorical
states:

The current SDD model for categorical characters is:

1. It is possible to defined shared state sets globally. Example:
color-states: red, green, blue, ...

2. The character definition list allows to define
 a) local states
 b) refer to 0 to several shared state sets (= inherit them)
    alpha) as a whole set
    beta) restricting the inheritance to states
          specified in an enumeration
    (Note: if the shared definition is expanded, alpha
      automatically inherits the new character, beta not)

3. The item descriptions always refers to states defined in
   the character definition list, never to global/shared
   definitions directly.

----------

I view this as a structural generalization, and tried to model
statistical parameters like min/mean/max/s.d./s.e./sample size etc.
accordingly:

1. Global measures define the semantics of for the first version of
SDD perhaps 30 parameters. In the first SDD version to keep it
simply, the list would not yet be exandable, but it is modeled such
that it is easily expandable later on. Statistical parameters already
carry descriptive attributes that allows for most purposes to
interpret them without referring the state code.

2. Within a numeric character in Terminology: character definition it
is possible to select only specific parameters.

3. in the item description only parameters selected by the designer
of the terminology can be used.

----------

Now in that admittedly confusing "special state" paper from March I
tried to figure out whether we should really (as implemented in
Brazil) use this same generalization for "special states" or "coding
status/missing data indicators"

1. A shared state set defining special states with fixed codes (i.e.
not user expandable in the first SDD version, but since all
information is already in the data, easily expandable in future
versions.

2. Within a character in Terminology: define which of these
   status/indicator states are to be enabled for a given character.

3. The item descriptions always refers to states defined in
   the character definition list, never to global/shared
   definitions directly.

----------

You propose to handle them separately. What would be the advantages
and disadvantages? Please add to the list if I overlook something:

Advantages:
a) avoid confusion in the definition of the terminology between
normal categorical states and "coding status/missing data
indicators". These things are structurally related in that both are
specific to a given character when the character is coded, but yield
information from different (although non-overlapping!) knowledge
domains, viz. biology for character states and knowledge meta data
for "coding status/missing data indicators".

Disadvantages:
a) the list is fixed and changes to the software are required if the
next SDD version extends another coding status.
b) reports can be generated only in the language of the program. If
the data are in German, but the software is English, the software
must add a special feature to translate the reporting of this
information into German.
c) when collating/compiling data from children, "coding
status/missing data indicators" must be handled identical with normal
data. That means especially, that the "coding status/missing data
indicators" must support multiple concurrent states:

 Item 1, character 1:
   state 1
 Item 2, character 1:
   coding status "excluded/scoped out"
 Item 3, character 1:
   coding status: "Not applicable"

if these 3 items are species within a genus, the compiled genus
description would be:

genus item, character 1:
  state 1, or "excluded/scoped out", or "Not applicable"

In which type of report this information would be made visible is
another question, i.e. a difference between the types of states
remains. However, it would be clearly inappropriate to summarize this
into just "state 1".

Note that I was especially delighted to see that probably the entire
question of character scoping automatically falls into place, without
any additional structural complexity, if "scoped out" can be
inherited as a default value from the taxonomic parents! This is my
only excuse that I included preliminary notes on the  issue of
default states in the special state paper, which made the paper a lot
more confusing!

---------------

This is my list, and on the basis of this list I would prefer to keep
the structural generalization, rather than implementing a completely
different mechanism. However, it is definitely good to take that step
back and rethink this.

To all: please respond if I currently overlook issues here!

However, even if "coding status/missing data indicators" are handled
analogous to shared categorical states and statistical parameters,
this does not mean, they have to be in one xml element. Whether a
database would store them in one table (would make sense to me) is
quite independent of this.

So, we could have (as an example, not necessarily the acutal schema):

Terminology
 SharedStates
   StatisticalParameters
   MissingDataIndicators / or CodingStatus
   CategoricalStates
 CharacterDefinition
   StatisticalParameters

Technical aside regarding the second version: I still don't fully
understand the implications of using the latter subtyping
("substitution group"?) version in regard to key/keyref constraints.
One thing is: is it possible to force the schema that xs:type is
required? It seems that this is only optional, and that if it is not
present it is up to the consuming application to figure out which
subtype is acutally used. However, whereas the CharacterDefininition
subtypes (StatisticalParametersDef) differ in their complex content
and can be recognized, the StatisticalParameterRef do not differ
EXCEPT in the keyref constraint. My guess is that therefore the above
does not work in xml schema, but please comment if you have insight
on this!

Let me see if I have this right:

Gregor wants to have a set of 'special states', globally applicable, that one can use to "score" the fact that e.g. one is not going to score a particular taxon x character:

      {note- these "special states" won't actually appear in the character list like this - they'll be defined separately, but the effect will be the same} Taxon x: code as "not scored (will score later)"


Steve Shattuck wants instead to have a modifying flag that can be set for the taxon x character cell in the data matrix, which flags that this cell is not going to be scored.

      Leaf shape
          ovate
          elliptic
          obovate Taxon x: not coded (flagged as "will score later")


It strikes me that
1. in some ways these two suggestions are very similar (whether the thing goes into the taxon x character cell or is attached to it is immaterial from a data point of view).
2. the real difference is in where their values are defined. Gregor's "special states" are defined in the instance document, while Steve's flags are (I assume) defined in the schema.

Does this make a difference?

Two differences I see:

a) The Brazil proposal allows the project designer to constrain which
"missing data indicators = special states = CodingStatus" are
available within a given character while scoring this character in an
item description.

This is why the "special states" occur indeed within a character
definition: They are not defined there, but by referring to the
global/shared definition level, they are _enabled_.

What I find nice is that this uses the same kind of mechanism the
inheritance of shared state sets uses: either inherit the full set
for a given character, or restrict it to certain states.

BUT: it is not necessary to do it like this. This is truly just my
private attempt to get some structural generalization into the model.

Also: I tried to raise the question of how important it is to be able
to enable/disable certain special states. I find it useful if the
list of special states has, say 5 options and you want to produce a
web interface, but I am uncertain whether it is worth it. If it is a
side-effect of having a structurally simple model, I welcome it, but
otherwise I can just as well live with "missing data indicators =
special states = CodingStatus" always enabled for all characters if
we can reach a consensus about that.

b) Second difference: special states do need a label/wording whenever
they are reported. To achieve multilinguality this wording must be
user-definable (i.e. by the designer of the project/the terminology).
To me this points into the direction of putting it into the xml
instance document, handling it like the state definitions. Again
other solutions are possible.

I am not fully happy with the way the Brazil model works, and it
obviously confuses people.

Perhaps one of the confusing things is that

1. SDD makes definitions
2. Project designer makes global/shared definitions
3. Project designer creates characters,
   referring to shared definitions (point 2 above),
   inheriting the properties of 0-several shared definitions, PLUS
   in the case of categorical states defines local states
   (but in the Brazil model not in the case of "statical parameters
   = global measures" or "special states")
4. The scientist using a designed project scores the
   descriptions based on the decisions of the designer
   of the terminology.

Because SDD is able to constrain things through the schema, this 4
layer model is acutally NOT represented in the Brazil model (and the
model could perhaps be made more understandable by changing that? I
really don't know!). Instead, SDD definitions like "Special states"
(or whatever better to call them) and "statistical parameters" are
treated like point 2, but the designer has only limited choice. The
xml schema requires the designer to have a given number of shared
definitions for special states and statistical parameters present in
that part.

However, this contraction allows the designer to add labels to these
required definition in new languages. I currently do not see a better
solution for this, but I welcome any suggestion!

Can anybody help me in making the explanations above or the questions
poised in "stepping back" more intelligable?

First: I do not have the solution and am feeding it! I am searching
it together with you. On the other hand, I have some vague ideas what
may work, and naturally these ideas influence me in the direction I
am going.

I tried to be very serious in stepping back and explaining why I
consider it a progress that made in the Brazil discussion: The
general sorting out of how to treat categorical states, numerical
statistical parameter, and coding states in a model that supports
extension in future SDD versions and multiple languages. Note that
text characters or states and numerical value lists are not yet
touched at all.

Steve: can you be more specific about what "doesn't make much sense"
to you? I often feel that my communication skills are inadequate.
However, I really did not want to give the impression in the
"stepping back to the generalized character definition..." posting
"No, that won't work because all the rest of it will break". I truly
welcome proposals that show alternative ways that are easier to
grasp.

However, the problems are connected. This is not specific to SDD. For
example, you cannot talk in DELTA about character dependency and
ignore how characters and states are modeled. The "Special states"
which I am very grateful you criticized in so much detail, is
embedded in the context of the Brazil proposal. In "stepping back" I
tried to summarize the relevant context and throw the discussion open
whether this should be changed.

Steve, we need much more input and feedback from you and others. Tell
me what do you propose to do that it is less frustrating?

I'm trying to write an introduction and primer for the SDD standard, and it strikes me that we don't actually have a name for the thing we're trying to create. SDD is short for the Structure of Descriptive Data, and is an acronym only for the subgroup, not for the standard. Anyone out there with a facility with acronyms?

relevant keywords include

taxonomy
descriptions
XML
markup
language
transform

there are surely more.

Dear Nick - I'd thought of TaxML and had rejected it as too boring - so was enormously amused to find that tax inspectors think it's just the ticket :-)

    I'm trying to write an introduction and primer for the SDD standard, and it strikes me that we don't actually have a name for the thing we're trying to create. SDD is short for the Structure of Descriptive Data, and is an acronym only for the subgroup, not for the standard. Anyone out there with a facility with acronyms?

    relevant keywords include

    taxonomy
    descriptions
    XML
    markup
    language
    transform

    there are surely more.

I agree, description is an essential part. But, of course, it doesn't need
to be an english-sounding acronym - something Latinate would be nice...k

So i'd suggest to keep it that way.

>>How about BIODDS - BIOlogical Descriptive Data Standard?
Biological Descriptive isn't very adequate here. Are we supposed to describe
populations ? genomes ? cells ? Just because bioinformatics usually means
molecular biology only shouldn't lead us to the same kind of attitude.

or BDDS...

but the data is probably a given in this day and age so we could get away
with BDS...

....

but most people would probably refer to it as the 'BD standard' so we could
shorten it further to BD...

and if we do the job properly and at the right level there is no reason why
it needs to be restricted to biology, so it could be the D standard...  or D

If the product that we are creating is serious and encompasses all of its

It is actually "Free DELTA" - as DELTA, the format, has since the beginning
been conceived as an open standard for data exchange. See the GNU Project at
www.gnu.org for clarifications of the terms "free" and "open" software.

<delurks/>

I don't make any particular claims to the name though, so
(re-)use it as you see fit.

btw, where would look for an update/docs on the new
standard? I'm curious whether any consideration was
given to using RDF, which provides a good framework
for collating data about resources from multiple sources
and using multiple vocabularies.

Cheers,

CAML is already a (excellent) programming language, see
http://caml.inria.fr/index-eng.html

And annotation or abstraction isn't specific to systematics moreover.

How many XML schemas are currently in work within TDWG(Collections, SDD,
Economic Botany, Geography, Spatial Data) and GBIF(DADI, ECAT, and DIGIT)?
Is there a way to unify them under some more universal schemaML naming
approach?  This seems like a unique moment in time to start a precedent.

The GBIF Biodiversity Data Architecture document is replete with models of
interfaces and web services that will all require new XML schemas to be
created--each needing a name. GBIF also intends to add schemas for taxa,
literature, gazeteers, indexes, providers, etc.

Is there a way to be more universal in naming these schemas?

The simple names like BioML, TaxML, etc. have already been used and are
probably too general anyway. (OmniML?)

One approach could be to concatentate dipthongs or something to create a
schema of ML names.  For example, BioDescML, BioTaxML, BioLitML.  Or BioDML,
BioTML, BioLML.  Or GBIFDescML.  Or TDWGDescML.

RE: Name for the standardAn excellent suggestion - perhaps we need to set up a TDWG working group to consider this and report in 12 months time.

By the way, there's a bottle of fine Portuguese port for whoever comes up with the final name. Of course, if no-one can come up with anything, the SDD group at Lisbon will have to drink the port as consolation.

just our of interest, what was wrong with SDD?  Is it really something that
needs a catchy name to market to the outside world?  Won't it just become
part of the information infrastructure that everyone takes for granted?

SDD stands for Structure of Descriptive Data - doesn't seem to me to do the
job, and I just thought it would be sensible for the standard to have a
different name from the group.

Of course, if we use SDD in the end, then the bottle of port is unclaimed.

By the way, I'd better correct my last email. Make that a cheap bottle of
Portugues port.

BODDS -Biological Ontological Descriptive Data Standard. It sounds kinda
sexy when you say BODDS outloud. Or very juvenile. Or both.

I'd kinda liked the idea of doing something in latin.

couldn't you just redefine the final product as 'Standard for Descriptive
Data', or if you want to be really creative and out there, 'Descriptive
Data Standard'?

Well!  That is one way to ensure that it stays as SDD!

(For docs see http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html. The
minutes and xsd draft changes from Paris are not finished yet by me,
however. Also Kevin is writing some introduction to the whole of SDD,
that hopefully makes it easier to understand.)

The application of RDF to SDD has been repeatedly discussed -- and is
currently avoided. It probably would be a good thing, everybody
agrees so, but most do not understand it well enough to really work
with it or profit from the definitional documents. I failed to
understand them. So we decided to try without RDF, rather than
debating little understood things. Any review of our results from you
would be great. If you can, come to Lisbon!

The workgroup name "Structure of descriptive data" was originally
explicitly chosen to describe an analysis process, rather than the
proposed standard.

However, there is already some history of calling our thing
"Structured Descriptive Data (SDD)". Used e.g. by Kevin Thiele, Bryan

I think SDD may be a good option for a new standard name if no other
term is really convincing. However, I also like Chucks idea of
putting all TDWG/GBIF standards under a common roof very much.
Without the TDWG subgroup 12 month later no decision yet extension,
of course.

Gregor,

yes, I agree that SDD (Standard for Descriptive Data) would do - I was just
looking for something a little more exciting. Cheers - k

.... I disagree :-) that "Standard for Descriptive Data"-standard
would do, I therefore propose "Structured Descriptive Data"-standard.
I absolutely agree with you about searching something more exciting.

There is a general name grabbing of most-general and all-encompassing
names (like BioML, which is really indecent...). Since we think about
the generalization from Biological to other collected objects all the
time and try to avoid too specifically biological jargon, we actually
have some justification following suit and grab

  DescriptionML ?

(for which Google returns 1 hit, which interestingly does not contain
the term, I even checked the html source...)

Do people in general think that we need to specify that we're working in the
taxonomic domain - something that the name SDD doesn't - or can we be
extremely general. Perhaps it's the case that SDD will be able to be used
for descriptions outside the taxonomic domain, and we should embrace this
(whether anyone else embraces us is another matter entirely) - k

I've been quietly following this discussion, and have a general question to
ask.  In the note below and in previous notes, there seems to be an emphasis
on SDD in the contect of "taxonomy"; but wouldn't it be more appropriate to
place the emphasis more in the context of biological objects (e.g.,
specimens), rather than abstract concepts (taxa)? Even though the
descriptive data may be applied directly to taxon concepts without an
explicit reference to specific specimens/objects, ultimately the characters
themselves that are being described are attached to a physical organism --
whether or not the specific physical organism is explicitly identified, or
merely implied.

Thus, when searching for another moniker to reference what we now refer to
as "SDD", I suggest that options along the lines of "Bio..." are preferable
to those along the lines of "Taxo...".

Ultimately, this is about a Standard for Structured Data to Describe
Biological Objects -- isn't it?  I doubt that "SSDDBO" will win the hearts
of many (or a shot at the bottle of cheap Portugues port). Personally, I'm
partial to the previously-suggested "BODDS".

Aloha,
Rich

I think  in theory the SDD spec could be used to describe anything that can be
broken into characteristics and states. That can certainly go beyond biology
as DELTA did in some cases. I believe that, "Structure of Descriptive Data"
handles that idea. It can be a description of anything. The description may
itself be grounded in instance data from the world (specimens) that have been
abstracted or summarized.

The taxonomy component is needed to specify what it is that is being
described. In the realm of biology it would seem to be worth some effort to be
domain specific in this part to make sure we can capture this reference to a
"taxonomic concept."

This is the part I'm having trouble understanding.  What is being
"Described" are characters....correct?  While it is true that researchers
have traditionally used character descriptions as a "short-hand" attempt to
delineate taxonomic concepts; the bottom line is that characters are
intrinsically part of actual living, breathing (respirating) physical
beings -- not the concepts (represented by names) that are intended to
circumscribe a set of individual organisms deemed to belong to a common
taxon.  When a taxonomist describes a character in the context of a taxon
concept, what is really being asserted is that the character as described is
shared by the primary type specimen of the name used to represent the
concept, as well as the primary type specimens of any/all names deemed to be
synonymous, as well as a wide swath of other individual organisms, a tiny
fraction of which have been collected and curated in Museums; the vast
majority of which live out their lives in their natural environment. In my
mind, characters belong to individual organisms -- to associate them
directly with taxon concepts (by way of the implied existence of individual
organisms that share the character) is merely a short-hand convenience.

Maybe this is getting off track, but my basic point is that if "SDD" is to
be qualified in any way, I think it should be qualified in terms of general
biology, or biological objects; not necessarily taxonomy.

I agree...but in my optimized view of the data management world, I'd like to
see characters linked with taxa via implied (if not real) specimens, even if
no specific physical specimen can be cited.  But if this is getting too
philosophical for the issue at hand, I'll gladly step back to my previous
status of quiet observer, so as not to clutter the list with tangential
issues.

Well, in practice (though perhaps not in philosophy) there isn't actually
any great difference between describing a specimen and "describing" a
taxon - in the former case we're describing a real thing (we don't actually
use describe the characters of the object, rather we use characters to
describe), in the latter case we're describing a 'platonic ideal' - an
idealised 'object'. In the same way we describe a triangle as being a three
sided figure and we describe the angles as equalling 180 degrees, but what
we're actually describing is a platonic triangle, not any real one.

The platonic taxon can be handled in exactly the same way as a real object -
we can say that a real specimen has leaves 10-15 cm long, and the taxon to
which it belongs has leaves 8-18 cm long - easy.

In Lucid we are implementing a system for coding specimens, and specimens
merely become twigs on the taxon tree. We don't even seem to find that we
need to specify that this node of the tree is a specimen and that node is a
taxon.

Note also that, for efficiency, different features are described at
different levels of the tree. Thus, whether the ovary is superior or
inferior is often most efficiently coded at family level, whether the leaves
are opposite or alternate may best be coded at genus level, what colour the
flowers are at species level, and how long the seeds are may be best at
specimen level. Ultimately, you're right, all coded features 'inherit' to
the ends of the tree (the specimens) but it would be inefficient to code, or
to store, the data there.

SDD still needs to visit specimen coding, but I think when we do we'll find
that it's trivial.

As to the scope of SDD, you're right that it should be possible in principle
to use it to describe the morphology of a widget, a soil, a nematode, or
perhaps even an asteroid. In practice, though, I doubt that it will be
useful for us to specifically scope SDD beyond the taxonomic domain -
probably the hardest domain to deal with anyway, so the ultimate challenge.

I quite like SDBO. Is there a courier service from Lisbon to Hawaii?

If the intent is to maintain it so generalized that it can be used in any
context, including abiotic ones (in the same sense that DiGIR is
specifically intended to be "Generic", not necessarily limited to biological
datasets), then I agree -- stick with "SDD".

I guess that lies at the heart of my original question.  I've been under the
impression that descriptive data about, for example, certain characteristics
of a leaf, are related to the tree from which the leaf fell, moreso than the
abstract taxonomic concept in which some taxonomist might include that tree
within. In that sense, I see "taxonomy" as a field that may very well be a
(the?) primary consumer of such descriptive data, but not necessarily what
the descriptive data is specifically endeavoring to describe.

I don't want to belabor this point, but I just would like to understand
whether taxonomic concepts are considered by this group as the direct
objects that are being described; or whether the descriptive data really
apply to individual (or sets of individual) organisms, which may or may not
be viewed within the context of a taxonomic concept.

Again, my apologies if this is drifting too far from the focus of this
discussion.

This is exactly the answer I needed -- thanks.  So yes, for obvious
practical reasons, described characters can apply directly to taxonomic
concepts.  But I guess the one lingering point I have is that the
descriptive data is not *necessarily* used only in the context of taxonomy,
and as such perhaps should not be confined to a taxonomic context by
whatever moniker is finally selected. I think that a taxon could be thought
of as a "Bioliogical Object", so that might be a more encompassing term.
But then again, if you don't want to confine it to living objects, then the
"Biological" could be discarded.

Nah -- just think warm thoughts next month in Portugal (wish I could attend,

well, maybe... depends on how abstract you want to be...  but I think I
would be inclined towards recording characters and their states to describe
the main game: a taxon.   You can get there by describing specimens, but
you do not have to.

>While it is true that researchers
>have traditionally used character descriptions as a "short-hand" attempt to
>delineate taxonomic concepts;

Using the perspective above, character description is the tool and not the
work... Characters can be described in the absence of a taxon. A taxon can
be described by the aggregate of the characters/states (described
elsewhere)  it does (or does not) possess.

>the bottom line is that characters are

At this point it is very easy to lapse metaphysical...  perhaps organs are
part of the organism but characters are an artificial human construct...  :)
[ Over the bottle of fine port one of us is going to win, we can solve this
one relatively quickly... ]

[ Thinks... Do characters always have to be defined in the context of a
taxon? ]

This is probably quite a defensible assertion...  the fact that taxonomy
exists at all is that we can generalize like this...

>In my

Or,  the organ and its attributes belongs to an organism... the character
and its states belongs to the human who defined it...

I agree - taxon description, documentation and identification, especially
as implemented in products such as Delta and Lucid, extends what we do far
beyond what could be considered taxonomy in the narrow sense.

>I agree...but in my optimized view of the data management world, I'd like to

yes - we have another project running here covering a key to Orchid
genera.  In this case we are not even scoring species level taxa, but we
are trying to cover the full range of variation in the genus and we are
recording which specimens have been used in this assessment so we can al
least go back and rescore if taxonomists change their minds (never! I hear
you say).   The argument is that if we actually scored the specimens all we
would have to do is recompile the key - nice, but unacceptably more work
for our budget...

As an information scientists and not a "taxonomists" in the systematics use of
the world, but certainly a taxonomists in the Library Science use of the word,
e.g. Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) I think the work practice now is to
describe higher level taxonomic concepts independent of the raw data the
specimen. It is the description of a class of objects not the object
themselves. Even at the species level the taxonomists is not claiming to have
seen all of the individuals, just enough to make generalizations. So I think
this generalization needs to be addressed by SDD. It would be icing on the
cake if SDD could deal with the relationship to instance data as well.

Leaving out "structured data", how about Biological Object Description
Markup Language - BiODML.

We could then have Biological Object Taxonomy Markup Language - BiOTML and
Biological Object Collection Markup Languag - BiOCML (now either Darwin
Core/DiGIR or ABCD?).

As an aside, won't all three of these languages need to fit together or
follow some consistent conventions to ultimately to feed data into a
complete GBIF data repository or global search service?  For instance, don't
they all include taxon name data?

you are right, in part.  Although the SDD activity is undertaken by
taxonomists, it extends beyond the core of taxonomy and nomenclature to
delineation and description of the objects themselves (taxa mostly, to a

My 2 cents is that "descriptive" doesn't need to be part of the resulting
name, at least not part of the acronym or codon that is used for the
resulting standard.  Most folks want biology to be part of the name.

How about "XBio" ?  Nothing like it shows up in any of the xml coverage I
can find (it is used for a variety of smallscale software projects).  It
doesn't have to actually stand for any literal phrase (I like the
<http://xml.coverpages.org/xci.html>New Mexico District Court XML Interface
(XCI) ) which has a similar derived structure, but at any rate could be
"XML for Biology".   Xbio is easy to pronounce, somewhat distinctive,
contemporary sounding and short.

Julian

P.S. Xtax is also pretty interesting as a acronym, nice pairing of x's and
also easy to say and remember.

See my previous email - what's so special about higher-level taxonomic
concepts cf specimens? The character space created to describe a taxon can
also be used perfectly well to describe a specimen of that taxon (and vice
versa) in most cases. In fact, it could not be any other way, when you think
about it.

Yes, at the moment we're not worrying too much about that, but obviously
when we include a taxon name, place name, authority, reference etc these
will all need to be harmonised with existing standards.

MEETING Details in Lisbon
=========================
My apologies for the late notice! I have been away and came back ill,
so I could only today get into the institute to have email access.

For the same reason, I did not manage to finish the Paris minutes,
which is a real pity. I would welcome if this time some other member
present could make the minutes of the meeting, perhaps different
people on different days.


Tuesday October 21
------------------
We meet at 9 (or perhaps a bit later, if the transport takes longer)
in the IGC, please see http://www.tdwg.org/2003meet/TDWG2003.htm for
further information.

I suggest that those staying in the Praia Mar hotel meet at 8:30 in
front of the reception (unless you receive a different notice about
shuttle transport when you arrive).

Wednesday October 22
--------------------
As above, we will convene at a room in the IGC and 9:00.

Thursday October 23
-------------------
No SDD meeting. Most will join the Taxonomic Names group, which will
be crucial to SDD as well to be able to produce full-fledged data
sets including taxonomic name information.

Friday October 24
-------------------
No SDD meeting. Some should join the ABCD group. It would be good if
the two schemata use some common elements/principles.

Saturday October 25
--------------------

SDD meets most day, see TDWG schedule
http://www.tdwg.org/2003meet/TDWG_2003_Plenary_Schedule.htm
for details

I look forward to meet you!

The easiest thing to do is to simply register under the new email.
The server will continue to contact your old address. If the old
address is no longer valid, it will automatically remove it from the
list after a while.

If this is a problem, I can try to remove the old address manually.

Best wishes

Hello everybody,

The silence after Lisbon this time unexpectedly does not mean we are
back to sleep. Together with Bob and Kevin I use all available time
in hammering out a new version of the SDD schema incorporating the
discussions from Lisbon and increasing the logic and consistency of
the schema.

Before we publish the entire schema, I would like to raise some
isolated and specific points in the coming days on the email list. I
would also like to point to Bobs WIKI
(http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/edit/SDD/) where some
discussions among us are going on.

Topic: Agents
=============

After Lisbon I changed the ContributorsDocumentation/Contributor
structure within Resources to "Agents/Agent".

Kevin writes:
> don't like "agents" much - what about "Contributors" instead of
> "Agents" and change the current "Contributors" to
"OtherContributors".

> Agents is an awkward term.

I basically agree with Kevin, Agents is not very nice. I used it
simply because ABCD is doing so.

However I don't like Contributors either.

1. I find it confusing being used twice with different meaning.
OtherContributors (i.e. other than Authors or Editors) is not very
nice either.

2. More fundamentally, all resources in SDD are objects and should
have object names. "Contributors" is a _role_ name and therefore not
very appropriate. The list of persons or organizations may be used in
other circumstances, albeit we currently have none in SDD.


Any good other term to denote "Person or Organization" in general,
without naming their role?

For technical reasons, it would be FAR better if people start at
http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/SDD/
than the address that Gregor gave.

The first time you try to make a contribution to the wiki you will be
invited to register.

I really hope most discussion takes place in the wiki, not in email.
It's a better discussion medium as most people agree after the 15 minute
learning curve.

In the current version of the SDD schema we have:

InternalNotes: A single element for all languages, intended for
internal documentation, annotations, memos during the development
process of either the terminology or descriptions. This is sort of
like a scrap page for authors or editors.

ReportedNotes: Free form notes/comments/annotations that address the
consumer of descriptive data. Multiple representations for each
audience/language addressed are available.

The pair InternalNotes/ReportedNotes is intended to express the fact
that Internal Notes are not usually published, whereas reported notes
are an essential part of the descriptive data.

----

I am currently thinking about whether different element names may be
more acceptable or intuitive.

* Using Annotation instead of InternalNotes
* Using FreeFormText instead of ReportedNotes.

We could use Notes instead of ReportedNotes, but I find the pair
Annotation/Notes easily confusible.

Please do "vote" on this issue on the email list!

I think it's a good idea that there's some traffic on the email list - we
just weren't getting people onto the wiki. What we need are some succinct
and brilliant wiki discussions, and by email point people to the wiki to get
them going.

I have transferred the content of this email to the wiki - see
http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/SDD/ChangeName

It would be *much* better if any comments are made through the wiki, and
voting (though this may be a trivial example) is conducted there. If any
luddites insist on carrying on a conversation on the list, I will
laboriously transfer it all to the wiki.

Cheers - k

This is carried out by the Intkey command 'Output Summary'. Any subset
of the taxa can be combined in this way. The output is a text file in
DELTA format. It can be done interactively, or by means of a script,
which can be run whenever the data are changed. For details, see the
DELTA-L posting
    Subject: Combining DELTA items
    Date: Fri, 27 Oct 2000
which is available in the list archive at
    http://listserv.surfnet.nl/archives/delta-l.html

We intended to put in the DELTA Editor a more general mechanism for
passing information between items. This would have allowed, for
example, species items to use information coded in genus items, and
vice versa. It would also have replaced the 'variant items' mechanism.
See
    Dallwitz, M. J., Paine, T. A. and Zurcher, E. J. (1993 onwards).
    Proposed new features for the DELTA system. http://delta-intkey.com

It's not clear from the description, but the second option is the one I
intended. I can't think of a plausible case where the first option
would be appropriate.

The sample data supplied with the DELTA programs contains a relevant
example.

The directives _are_ convertible. The example in Section 3.5.1 of the
DELTA User's Guide is taken from the sample data. To confirm that the
two forms are equivalent, take the 'APPLICABLE CHARACTERS' version
given in the User's Guide, and substitute it for the 'DEPENDENT
CHARACTERS' version in the specifications file of the sample data. Then
run 'Confor check', and you will find that no errors are reported.

Actually, DELTA and Lucid are not qualitatively different in this
regard - they both have the states organized into characters. The only
differences are in the kinds and amount of information associated with
each state in the data matrix. Associated with each state, the current
version of DELTA has an unrestricted amount of free-text information,
Intkey has 1 bit of information (present/absent), and Lucid has 8 bits
of coded information. The proposed new version of DELTA (Dallwitz et
al., loc. cit.) had both free text and coded information associated
with each state and character in the matrix. The coded information
included all the types used by the current Lucid.

At least one program, MEKA, does use a state matrix, i.e. the states
are not grouped into characters.

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

As decided at the TDWG Annual Meeting, 21-26 October 2003 in Lisbon,
on 1. December 2003 we did release a stable review version "SDD 0.9".
However, it took me, Bob, and Kevin several weeks longer to finish
the associated documentations. Please take a look at:

  http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html

and follow the link under "Overview of available schema
documentation".

It is shortly before Christmas and hopefully most of us have other
things to do or think than SDD. However, if you should have some time
over the holidays, or perhaps your new year's resolutions list is not
yet overly full, please do try to get involved.

We urgently need a fresh review and detailed criticism, especially
from those who either hold descriptive data, develop applications for
the identification of biodiversity, or are involved in GBIF and
intend to consume descriptive data.

The preferred medium for discussion is the SDD WIKI (see starting
page for link and explanation). If you have problems using the WIKI
do not hesitate to use the list instead. Please also respond to minor
issues and errors, perhaps by direct mail, so that we can eliminate
them over time.

Merry Christmas greetings to all of you,

Gregor

Hello all,

My apologies for the spread of a damaging virus!

Gregor

PS: I was actually completely offline for the last 2 weeks, and my
own computer seems to be clean. Our firewall-and-virus-scan-and-all
protected intranet was infected, however, and I suspect that acutally
a mail server became infected.

I have got a little ways with the glossary, and was trying to get in
touch with Fl. Aust. over the possibility of integrating their
piccies - is the person with whom I should be in touch the same (I
have forgotten her name - sent an e-mail, but no reply) as it was a
year ago?

FYI http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/glossary1.html should
show you where we are at.

Gregor

I have written a rough document considering several aspects of the
SDD-schema - largely interpreted with reference to our Prometheus Database
model for descriptive data. It seems easier to keep this all together,
rather than post it to various sections on twiki, so i am attaching it here

My main problems in interpreting the schema were the lack of documentation (
as always...) especially for the conceptually complex parts like concept
trees. I think clear, visual  summary models for description, characters,
concept trees etc would help a novice to get to grips with the concepts, and
might make some of the complexities more tractable. I do worry that the
overall schema is over complex and 'trying to do too much in one go' - eg
considering multiple language and expertise representations, although I am
sure that there are good political reasons for everything.....

yours

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=977562610-15032004>I have written a
rough document considering several aspects of the SDD-schema - largely
interpreted with reference to our Prometheus Database model for descriptive
data. It seems easier to keep this all together, rather than post it to various
sections on twiki, so i am attaching it here</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN class=977562610-15032004>My main problems in
interpreting the schema were the lack of documentation ( as always...)
especially for the conceptually complex parts like concept trees. I think clear,
visual&nbsp; summary models for description, characters, concept trees etc would
help a novice to get to grips with the concepts, and might make some of the
complexities more tractable. I do worry that the overall schema is over complex
and 'trying to do too much in one go' - eg considering multiple language and
expertise representations, although I am sure that there are good political
reasons for everything.....</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

Dear Trevor,

I watched from a far intellectual distance (not being a computer
scientist or a taxonomist) as my colleague Bob Morris helped develop the
SDD schema. Occasionally Bob and I would discuss the the broader issues
of how standards are recieved by a community and how or why they get adopted

I know there was a great deal of time and thought put into the proposed
standard and that your comments will be very helpful to the committee
and to someone like me trying to understand the issues.

Your email also highlights the equally important communication and
sociological issues with standards. I hope your comments will stimulate
a broader dialogue.

Trevor - thanks very much for your comments and comparative document - =
this is really useful, and we need to get much more feedback like this.

The main difference between SDD and Prometheus seems to be that you are =
working specifically on the basis of defining a controlled terminology =
whereas SDD explicitly decided early on that a controlled terminology =
was outside our scope. History will judge which approach is best.

We did have early discussions about a controlled terminology (see the =
list archives for a history of this).One dificulty for us is that SDD is =
designed to be biology-wide (indeed, we have even removed specific =
references to biology, such as "taxon", because SDD is equally =
applicable to descriptions of non-taxa such as diseases, nutrient =
deficiency syndromes, soils and minerals. Perhaps here we have drawn our =
bow too wide, but we were informed by the fact that at our Lisbon =
meeting all but one of the contributors who were working with =
identification tools had removed their biology-specific tags to become =
more general). Prometheus (as I understand it from your document) is =
specifically botanical. This would be an intolerable restriction for us =
given our brief.

Obviously, a botany-wide controlled terminology is more achievable than =
a biology-wide one. Personally, however, I think that you run the danger =
even in botany with any controlled terminology of trying to force nature =
kicking and screaming into small boxes, and do it an injustice =
therewith. I don't know how any botany-wide controlled terminology could =
cope with the leaves of Drosera auriculata, for instance, or the =
morphology of Podostemaceae. (In fact, I wonder whether the dream of a =
controlled terminology is more likely in a cold Northern Hemisphere =
climate than in the biodiverse South or tropics?).

In general, we have taken the view that a controlled terminology in =
particular domains (e.g. legumes) may develop as an emergent property of =
SDD, rather than imposed top-down.

On more specific points from your document:

Complexity: SDD was scoped to be a superset of existing systems and =
standards e.g. DELTA, Lucid, DeltaAcess, and also to accommodate future =
developments that those of us working in the field can envisage but =
no-one's really done yet (particularly federation issues - and you may =
be further down this track than we are). This is part of the reason for =
the complexity,

>It is not clear to me whether SDD is proposing this schema as=20
>a unifying schema to which different description formats would map =
their own schema=20
>or=20
>whether the SDD schema is being proposed as a schema for developers to =
(partially) implement when designing applications >and repositories for =
capturing descriptive data.


It is designed as a unifying standard, to allow lossless roundtripping =
between applications. At the same time, we are struggling with how much =
should be mandatory and how much optional (your second option)



>From our own collaborative experiences with botanical taxonomists, data =
models and structures hold no interest to them in >practice, and they =
find even our simple conceptual model of character description complex =
to understand. Probably few working >taxonomists would wish to interact =
at any level with the SDD schema and applications would have to achieve =
this mapping >transparently.



On this I'm sure you're right, and we have had many discussions within =
SDD about this problem. There are differing views as to the importance =
of taxonomists themselves coming to grips with SDD, as the standard =
itself will generally be invisible to a taxonomist using an =
SDD-compliant application.



Translation and multiple language representations: allowing multiple =
languages is seen as a fundamental part of the SDD brief. Life would =
indeed be much simpler if everyone spoke the same language, but they =
don't so we need to handle that.=20



>It is not clear whether SDD proposes that a single document can include =
multiple language representations, or whether these >would form separate =
documents, conforming to the same standard



SDD can handle multiple language representations of every character =
string within the one document.



Multiple expertise levels



>I am similarly suspicious of the necessity for including the ability =
for recording different expertise levels in one document format. >Is SDD =
proposing/allowing multiple representations within the same document : =
or just that the same format/standard can be >used for documents aimed =
at different expertise level.

>=20

>There clearly is value in being able to extract/translate simple =
language descriptions from complex data resources - as is >necessary for =
compiling flora and keys from monographs and original descriptions. =
However, is including the ability to describe >descriptive data in =
language suitable for primary schoolchildren relevant to an accurate =
scientific database of taxonomic data. [Again this would appear to be a =
political requirement??]

  Gregor

  I have written a rough document considering several aspects of the =
SDD-schema - largely interpreted with reference to our Prometheus =
Database model for descriptive data. It seems easier to keep this all =
together, rather than post it to various sections on twiki, so i am =
attaching it here

  My main problems in interpreting the schema were the lack of =
documentation ( as always...) especially for the conceptually complex =
parts like concept trees. I think clear, visual  summary models for =
description, characters, concept trees etc would help a novice to get to =
grips with the concepts, and might make some of the complexities more =
tractable. I do worry that the overall schema is over complex and =
'trying to do too much in one go' - eg considering multiple language and =
expertise representations, although I am sure that there are good =
political reasons for everything.....

  yours

-----------------------------

Hi Trevor - thanks very much for your comments and comparative document =
- this is really useful, and we need to get much more feedback like =
this.

The main difference between SDD and Prometheus seems to be that you are =
working specifically on the basis of defining a controlled terminology =
whereas SDD explicitly decided early on that a controlled terminology =
was outside our scope. History will judge which approach is best.

We did have early discussions about a controlled terminology (see the =
list archives for a history of this).One dificulty for us is that SDD is =
designed to be biology-wide (indeed, we have even removed specific =
references to biology, such as "taxon", because SDD is equally =
applicable to descriptions of non-taxa such as diseases, nutrient =
deficiency syndromes, soils and minerals. Perhaps here we have drawn our =
bow too wide, but we were informed by the fact that at our Lisbon =
meeting all but one of the contributors who were working with =
identification tools had removed their biology-specific tags to become =
more general). Prometheus (as I understand it from your document) is =
specifically botanical. This would be an intolerable restriction for us =
given our brief.

Obviously, a botany-wide controlled terminology is more achievable than =
a biology-wide one. Personally, however, I think that you run the danger =
even in botany with any controlled terminology of trying to force nature =
kicking and screaming into small boxes, and do it an injustice =
therewith. I don't know how any botany-wide controlled terminology could =
cope with the leaves of Drosera auriculata, for instance, or the =
morphology of Podostemaceae. (In fact, I wonder whether the dream of a =
controlled terminology is more likely in a cold Northern Hemisphere =
climate than in the biodiverse South or tropics?).

In general, we have taken the view that a controlled terminology in =
particular domains (e.g. legumes) may develop as an emergent property of =
SDD, rather than imposed top-down.

On more specific points from your document:

Complexity: SDD was scoped to be a superset of existing systems and =
standards e.g. DELTA, Lucid, DeltaAcess, and also to accommodate future =
developments that those of us working in the field can envisage but =
no-one's really done yet (particularly federation issues - and you may =
be further down this track than we are). This is part of the reason for =
the complexity,

=20

It is designed as a unifying standard, to allow lossless roundtripping =
between applications. At the same time, we are struggling with how much =
should be mandatory and how much optional (your second option)

=20

On this I'm sure you're right, and we have had many discussions within =
SDD about this problem. There are differing views as to the importance =
of taxonomists themselves coming to grips with SDD, as the standard =
itself will generally be invisible to a taxonomist using an =
SDD-compliant application.

=20

Translation and multiple language representations: allowing multiple =
languages is seen as a fundamental part of the SDD brief. Life would =
indeed be much simpler if everyone spoke the same language, but they =
don't so we need to handle that.=20

SDD can handle multiple language representations of every character =
string within the one document.

Multiple expertise levels

=20

This is not a political requirement, but an attempt to broaden the =
application of taxonomy beyond taxonomists (surely a requirement if the =
taxonomic crisis is to be resolved). It also derives neatly from the XML =
underpinning (XML is based on the idea of multiple representations of a =
single document)=20

=20

Defining the descriptive terminology



>Are you suggesting that the SDD Terminology Section will be adequate =
and appropriate to store=20
>and represent any (allowed) defined terminology?

Yes, we hope so. Do you think it will be inadequate?

>Is the standard going to allow descriptions to reference other defined =
terminologies?

It will be possible to outsource the terminology section, so if a group =
creates a controlled vocabulary, that could be referenced in multiple =
SDD documents. So presumably Prometheus could be the source of a =
controlled vocabulary that other users (of they found it adequate) could =
reference.

>Would SDD only accept Data marked up in an SDD terminology?

Yes - or do I misunderstand this question?

>Would existing terminologies have to be translated/mapped/redescribed =
in SDD format?

Any existing terminology can be represented in SDD, so there will be no =
remapping necessary.

>Who is going to create terminologies, e.g.gusers on an adhoc basis, or =
expert user groups?

As above, these may develop particularly for some groups (e.g. ferns, =
legumes), but some users may choose to stay outside such a system (there =
will be benefits and costs of using a controlled vocabulary, so people =
will have to weigh it up for themselves). SDD itself is agnostic.

>Is it an aim to promote re-use and sharing of terminologies?

It would be a desirable outcome, but we hope it evolves bottom-up rather =
than being imposed top-down.

>Is there going to be policing of SDD terminologies, e.g. maintaining =
versioning, additions etc?

Versioning will be handled within SDD, but there can be no possibility =
of policing a system.

>How was the terminology section created - by examining examples of =
terminology specifications,=20
>ontology representations etc?

We have had a mix of off-the-top-of-the-head speculation as to how best =
to do things, and proofing of concepts against real-world examples. I =
would have liked to see more proofing going on during development, but =
this has been hard to maintain, and may be to our cost. We are nbow at a =
phase where several groups are trting to implement SDD-compliance for =
their systems - this will be the proof of the pudding.

Note also that SDD is currently v0.9 - with the explicit statement on =
release that everything may change if we find that the proofing fails.

>Does it form a standard template for storing a terminology?=20

What do you mean by this. It provides the standard schema for =
representing an (undefined) terminology.

>Is it compatible with any existing tools, standards or formats - e.g. =
ontology editors?

We have specifically made it very general. There is currently no =
existing tool that can handle SDD. Hopefull this will change shortly.

----------------------------------
So does Prometheus have any data yet, or is it still at the model stage? =
It would be very interesting to try representing Prometheus data in SDD.

  Subject: SDD Schema in relationship to Prometheus


  Gregor

  I have written a rough document considering several aspects of the =
SDD-schema - largely interpreted with reference to our Prometheus =
Database model for descriptive data. It seems easier to keep this all =
together, rather than post it to various sections on twiki, so i am =
attaching it here

  My main problems in interpreting the schema were the lack of =
documentation ( as always...) especially for the conceptually complex =
parts like concept trees. I think clear, visual  summary models for =
description, characters, concept trees etc would help a novice to get to =
grips with the concepts, and might make some of the complexities more =
tractable. I do worry that the overall schema is over complex and =
'trying to do too much in one go' - eg considering multiple language and =
expertise representations, although I am sure that there are good =
political reasons for everything.....

  yours

Thanks for your reply, it is becoming much clearer to me that actually alot
of our thoughts are convergent ( probably because we are all thinking about
the same issues.... ). You have clarified a lot of ipoints, and i have added
a little more clarification below....
It looks like a worthwhile task would be to try and represent our angiosperm
terminology in SDD format at some stage ( time permitting etc...as ever).
This is probably more straightforward than representing our descriptive data
according to SDD as our underlying data model is quite different insome
aspects ( I think!!!).
cheers

-----------------------------

Hi Trevor - thanks very much for your comments and comparative document -
this is really useful, and we need to get much more feedback like this.

The main difference between SDD and Prometheus seems to be that you are
working specifically on the basis of defining a controlled terminology
whereas SDD explicitly decided early on that a controlled terminology was
outside our scope. History will judge which approach is best.
[Paterson, Trevor]
a controlled terminology was not such a large feature of our work initially
- we were more interested in the model for saving 'character' data - however
it became obvious that the only way to allow unambiguous interpretation of
data  - for reuse, comparison etc - was to provide full definitions. it then
seemed desirable that people would share definitions to allow
compatability.......whether this will be achieved by bottom up adoption is
an open question. Taxonomists don seem to like the idea of top down
imposition - tho they may be happier when it is restricted to quite a small
domain of users

We did have early discussions about a controlled terminology (see the list
archives for a history of this).One dificulty for us is that SDD is designed
to be biology-wide (indeed, we have even removed specific references to
biology, such as "taxon", because SDD is equally applicable to descriptions
of non-taxa such as diseases, nutrient deficiency syndromes, soils and
minerals. Perhaps here we have drawn our bow too wide, but we were informed
by the fact that at our Lisbon meeting all but one of the contributors who
were working with identification tools had removed their biology-specific
tags to become more general). Prometheus (as I understand it from your
document) is specifically botanical. This would be an intolerable
restriction for us given our brief.
[Paterson, Trevor]
We are constrained by the expertise of whoever we are collaborating with...
the taxonomists at RBGE are full partners in this project so the 'test
domains' reflect their interests  and expertise ( or we will never get real
test data). We hope that our character model will be applicable to the whole
field of biological taxonomy - - and that specific ontologies/terminologies
could be developed to allow description of other groups ( mammals, insects
etc)

Obviously, a botany-wide controlled terminology is more achievable than a
biology-wide one. Personally, however, I think that you run the danger even
in botany with any controlled terminology of trying to force nature kicking
and screaming into small boxes, and do it an injustice therewith. I don't
know how any botany-wide controlled terminology could cope with the leaves
of Drosera auriculata, for instance, or the morphology of Podostemaceae. (In
fact, I wonder whether the dream of a controlled terminology is more likely
in a cold Northern Hemisphere climate than in the biodiverse South or
tropics?).
[Paterson, Trevor]
Yes - we know that diverse taxa would probably require specific ontologies.
We may be able to develope a system that allows a core central terminology -
with taxon specific extensions.....We want to allow MEANINGFUL  comparison
of data - and often there is no need or sense in comparing data across
widely divergent taxa  ie you would might want to compare the properties of
stalks on angiosperm flowers, but it is probably of no taxonomic interest to
compare these with the stalks of a slime mould fruiting body...............

In general, we have taken the view that a controlled terminology in
particular domains (e.g. legumes) may develop as an emergent property of
SDD, rather than imposed top-down.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Yes  - this is the working model we have come round to...users develope an
ontology and share it with colleagues in a closely related field etc....

On more specific points from your document:

Complexity: SDD was scoped to be a superset of existing systems and
standards e.g. DELTA, Lucid, DeltaAcess, and also to accommodate future
developments that those of us working in the field can envisage but no-one's
really done yet (particularly federation issues - and you may be further
down this track than we are). This is part of the reason for the complexity,

>It is not clear to me whether SDD is proposing this schema as
>a unifying schema to which different description formats would map their
own schema
>or
>whether the SDD schema is being proposed as a schema for developers to
(partially) implement when designing applications
>and repositories for capturing descriptive data.



It is designed as a unifying standard, to allow lossless roundtripping
between applications. At the same time, we are struggling with how much
should be mandatory and how much optional (your second option)



>From our own collaborative experiences with botanical taxonomists, data
models and structures hold no interest to them in

>practice, and they find even our simple conceptual model of character
description complex to understand. Probably few working

>taxonomists would wish to interact at any level with the SDD schema and
applications would have to achieve this mapping

>transparently.



On this I'm sure you're right, and we have had many discussions within SDD
about this problem. There are differing views as to the importance of
taxonomists themselves coming to grips with SDD, as the standard itself will
generally be invisible to a taxonomist using an SDD-compliant application.
[Paterson, Trevor]

The problem is that someone has to write and implement the applications (
e.g. me !) - and they have to do this in collaboration with taxonomists - or
it will be perceived as an irrelevant imposition - -therefore it will always
be necessary to get at least some  taxonomists from a variety of fields to
understand the schema...

>From my perspective actually it seems much easier for computer scientists to
get to grips with taxonomy rather than vice versa - ( although taxonmists
would be a bit defensive about this....)



Translation and multiple language representations: allowing multiple
languages is seen as a fundamental part of the SDD brief. Life would indeed
be much simpler if everyone spoke the same language, but they don't so we
need to handle that.



>It is not clear whether SDD proposes that a single document can include
multiple language representations, or whether these

>would form separate documents, conforming to the same standard



SDD can handle multiple language representations of every character string
within the one document.
[Paterson, Trevor]

Still not convinced allowing multiple language representations would mace
for good/accurate science



Multiple expertise levels



>I am similarly suspicious of the necessity for including the ability for
recording different expertise levels in one document format.

>Is SDD proposing/allowing multiple representations within the same document

>[Again this would appear to be a political requirement??]



This is not a political requirement, but an attempt to broaden the
application of taxonomy beyond taxonomists (surely a requirement if the
taxonomic crisis is to be resolved). It also derives neatly from the XML
underpinning (XML is based on the idea of multiple representations of a
single document)
[Paterson, Trevor]

Yes I see where you are coming from - i think the probelm is that
taxonomists are concerned about accurate representation of their data for
their purposes - making a shareable version of this is not perceived as of
any value to them - they want a scientific tool to do their job - i am not
sure how /if we could encourage a dual markup approach  - or whether
different 'markets' for descriptive data would exist independently -



Defining the descriptive terminology



>Are you suggesting that the SDD Terminology Section will be adequate and
appropriate to store
>and represent any (allowed) defined terminology?

Yes, we hope so. Do you think it will be inadequate?
[Paterson, Trevor]
It probably would be adequate to store Prometheus terminologies  - with
minor tinkering, the semantics of the terminolgies could be saved just with
glossary entries and relationships etc - but would obviously require
interpetation by suitable applications. I cant understand concept trees well
enough to get a feel for whether they could store the semantics of a
terminolgy more explicitly.....
However, that is not to say SDD could cope with other terminolgies  that
might have further unforseen relationships - there might need to be a
facility for recording 'user defined' relationships such as our stategroup
membership and restrictions between these and sets of structures - i think
that these type of relationships are representable in concept trees - but
would need a primer/ turotial to show me how.

>Is the standard going to allow descriptions to reference other defined
terminologies?

It will be possible to outsource the terminology section, so if a group
creates a controlled vocabulary, that could be referenced in multiple SDD
documents. So presumably Prometheus could be the source of a controlled
vocabulary that other users (of they found it adequate) could reference.

>Would SDD only accept Data marked up in an SDD terminology?

Yes - or do I misunderstand this question?
[Paterson, Trevor]
If i understand your previous remark - you could have completely external
termnologies - that SDD 'knows' nothing about the structure and semantics -
so it would have to accept 'non-SDD' terminology

>Would existing terminologies have to be translated/mapped/redescribed in
SDD format?

Any existing terminology can be represented in SDD, so there will be no
remapping necessary.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Again this will only be knowable if people try doing it. Obviously if there
is a standard structure people would be encouraged to use it - but
prexisting description ontologies ( eg PlantOnology and GeneOntology) would
not want to retrofit to the standard....even if there is no ' rdesign or
remapping necessary - there is the matter of re-expressing it in an SDD
format

>Who is going to create terminologies, e.g.gusers on an adhoc basis, or
expert user groups?

As above, these may develop particularly for some groups (e.g. ferns,
legumes), but some users may choose to stay outside such a system (there
will be benefits and costs of using a controlled vocabulary, so people will
have to weigh it up for themselves). SDD itself is agnostic.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Almost our opinion - but we are not agnostic - we believe 'interpretability'
and 'reusability' are Gods, and we should proselytize on their behalfs -
gently of course - by offering only carrots and no sticks...

>Is it an aim to promote re-use and sharing of terminologies?

It would be a desirable outcome, but we hope it evolves bottom-up rather
than being imposed top-down.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Sure

>Is there going to be policing of SDD terminologies, e.g. maintaining
versioning, additions etc?

Versioning will be handled within SDD, but there can be no possibility of
policing a system
[Paterson, Trevor]
This what really worries the taxonomists - imposed standards reducing the
flexibility and expressivity of their descriptions - and hatred of a police
state. I think standardisation WILL be perceived to lead to a loss of
expressivity - but as often one person's expressivity is another'; s
incomprehensivity to an outsider this seems like potentially 'a good thing'
( in small doses obviously)........


>How was the terminology section created - by examining examples of
terminology specifications,
>ontology representations etc?

We have had a mix of off-the-top-of-the-head speculation as to how best to
do things, and proofing of concepts against real-world examples. I would
have liked to see more proofing going on during development, but this has
been hard to maintain, and may be to our cost. We are nbow at a phase where
several groups are trting to implement SDD-compliance for their systems -
this will be the proof of the pudding.

Note also that SDD is currently v0.9 - with the explicit statement on
release that everything may change if we find that the proofing fails.

>Does it form a standard template for storing a terminology?

What do you mean by this. It provides the standard schema for representing
an (undefined) terminology.

>Is it compatible with any existing tools, standards or formats - e.g.
ontology editors?

We have specifically made it very general. There is currently no existing
tool that can handle SDD. Hopefull this will change shortly.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Keep me posted

----------------------------------
So does Prometheus have any data yet, or is it still at the model stage? It
would be very interesting to try representing Prometheus data in SDD.
[Paterson, Trevor] to date  we have

*

        the model ( and a data base implementation to save model compliant
data)
*

        a tool for creating simple terminologies -  with definitions,
PartOf, Typeof, Stategroup relations etc
*

        a prototype angiosperm terminology/ontology
*

        a prototype tool for using onologies to specify project description
templates ( proformas)
*

        which also allows recordng of specimen descriptions
*

        the ability to save these descriptions to the database in the model
compliant format

and we are currently getting user testing done on the prototype by the
taxonomists, who are making proformas adn saving specimen descriptions. We
are just about ready to use the tool for a 'real' project if we can get time
and interest to do this...eg for a small taxonomic revision. We are rapidly
approaching the end of our project funding however.. so it may switch to
being a 'back burner' project....



Cheers - k

Subject: SDD Schema in relationship to Prometheus


Gregor

I have written a rough document considering several aspects of the
SDD-schema - largely interpreted with reference to our Prometheus Database
model for descriptive data. It seems easier to keep this all together,
rather than post it to various sections on twiki, so i am attaching it here

My main problems in interpreting the schema were the lack of documentation (
as always...) especially for the conceptually complex parts like concept
trees. I think clear, visual  summary models for description, characters,
concept trees etc would help a novice to get to grips with the concepts, and
might make some of the complexities more tractable. I do worry that the
overall schema is over complex and 'trying to do too much in one go' - eg
considering multiple language and expertise representations, although I am
sure that there are good political reasons for everything.....

yours

Trevor,

I agree that there will be considerable congruence between SDD and
Prometheus, imposed by the needs of the system. The main difference is in
our decision early on not to constrain a taxonomist's ability to express any
necessary differences in SDD.

We looked at a proscribed part-region-property-state data model such as
you've developed for Prometheus early on, and rejected it in favour of a
more general, simple character-state model (such as DELTA had; with the
extension that characters may optionally be arranged into character
hierarchies).

For instance, in an interactive key that I published a few years ago (The
Families of Flowering Plants of Australia, in Lucid), I have (amongst many
others) the following characters:

Salt tolerance
  plants tolerating high salt levels (halophytes)
  plants not salt tolerant

General habit
  tree
  shrub
  climber (woody or herbaceous)
  herb
  grass- or sedge-like plant

Epiphytic or lithophytic habit
  plants growing in soil (not epiphytic or lithophytic)
  plants growing on other plants or on bare rock surfaces (epiphytic or
lithophytic)

Habit (aquatic herbs only)
  free-floating
  rooted in substrate with leaves all or mostly submerged
  rooted in substrate with leaves mostly floating on the water surface
  rooted in substrate with leaves mostly emergent above the water surface

Seasonal longevity
  annual, biennial or ephemeral
  perennial

Seasonality of leaves (woody plants)
  evergreen
  deciduous or semi-deciduous

Structures for spreading vegetatively
  none (plants not spreading vegetatively)
  underground bulbs, corms or tubers etc
  rhizomes, stolons or root-suckers
  detached aerial stem parts, bulbils or proliferous flowerheads

Chlorophyll in stems or leaves
  present (plants green or grey-green)
  absent (plants colourless, white or yellowish)

  carnivorous

Trap structures (carnivorous plants only)

  sticky glands or glandular hairs on leaves and/or stems

I don't see how it would be possible to represent these in your data model,
but as a taxonomist I need to represent them for my purpose. There would be
no problem with these in SDD.

The good news I suppose is that since SDD is (hopefully) more general, there
should be no problem rendering your data in SDD. The more interesting
question is whether your data *model* (the part-structure stuff) would come
out the other end of an SDD roundtrip.

It should be possible, if you represent you part-structure stuff in a
character hierarchy, and assume after roundtripping that the hierarchy you
get back can still be interpreted in the same way. That is, you would need
to check whether the hierarchy you receive conforms with your model (and I
suppose reject it if it does not).

Kevin
Thanks for your reply, it is becoming much clearer to me that actually alot
of our thoughts are convergent ( probably because we are all thinking about
the same issues.... ). You have clarified a lot of ipoints, and i have added
a little more clarification below....
It looks like a worthwhile task would be to try and represent our angiosperm
terminology in SDD format at some stage ( time permitting etc...as ever).
This is probably more straightforward than representing our descriptive data
according to SDD as our underlying data model is quite different insome
aspects ( I think!!!).

-----------------------------

Hi Trevor - thanks very much for your comments and comparative document -
this is really useful, and we need to get much more feedback like this.

The main difference between SDD and Prometheus seems to be that you are
working specifically on the basis of defining a controlled terminology
whereas SDD explicitly decided early on that a controlled terminology was
outside our scope. History will judge which approach is best.
[Paterson, Trevor]
a controlled terminology was not such a large feature of our work
initially - we were more interested in the model for saving 'character'
data - however it became obvious that the only way to allow unambiguous
interpretation of data  - for reuse, comparison etc - was to provide full
definitions. it then seemed desirable that people would share definitions to
allow compatability.......whether this will be achieved by bottom up
adoption is an open question. Taxonomists don seem to like the idea of top
down imposition - tho they may be happier when it is restricted to quite a
small domain of users

We did have early discussions about a controlled terminology (see the list
archives for a history of this).One dificulty for us is that SDD is designed
to be biology-wide (indeed, we have even removed specific references to
biology, such as "taxon", because SDD is equally applicable to descriptions
of non-taxa such as diseases, nutrient deficiency syndromes, soils and
minerals. Perhaps here we have drawn our bow too wide, but we were informed
by the fact that at our Lisbon meeting all but one of the contributors who
were working with identification tools had removed their biology-specific
tags to become more general). Prometheus (as I understand it from your
document) is specifically botanical. This would be an intolerable
restriction for us given our brief.
[Paterson, Trevor]
We are constrained by the expertise of whoever we are collaborating with...
the taxonomists at RBGE are full partners in this project so the 'test
domains' reflect their interests  and expertise ( or we will never get real
test data). We hope that our character model will be applicable to the whole
field of biological taxonomy - - and that specific ontologies/terminologies
could be developed to allow description of other groups ( mammals, insects
etc)

Obviously, a botany-wide controlled terminology is more achievable than a
biology-wide one. Personally, however, I think that you run the danger even
in botany with any controlled terminology of trying to force nature kicking
and screaming into small boxes, and do it an injustice therewith. I don't
know how any botany-wide controlled terminology could cope with the leaves
of Drosera auriculata, for instance, or the morphology of Podostemaceae. (In
fact, I wonder whether the dream of a controlled terminology is more likely
in a cold Northern Hemisphere climate than in the biodiverse South or
tropics?).
[Paterson, Trevor]
Yes - we know that diverse taxa would probably require specific ontologies.
We may be able to develope a system that allows a core central terminology -
with taxon specific extensions.....We want to allow MEANINGFUL  comparison
of data - and often there is no need or sense in comparing data across
widely divergent taxa  ie you would might want to compare the properties of
stalks on angiosperm flowers, but it is probably of no taxonomic interest to
compare these with the stalks of a slime mould fruiting body...............

In general, we have taken the view that a controlled terminology in
particular domains (e.g. legumes) may develop as an emergent property of
SDD, rather than imposed top-down.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Yes  - this is the working model we have come round to...users develope an
ontology and share it with colleagues in a closely related field etc....

On more specific points from your document:

Complexity: SDD was scoped to be a superset of existing systems and
standards e.g. DELTA, Lucid, DeltaAcess, and also to accommodate future
developments that those of us working in the field can envisage but no-one's
really done yet (particularly federation issues - and you may be further
down this track than we are). This is part of the reason for the complexity,

>It is not clear to me whether SDD is proposing this schema as
>a unifying schema to which different description formats would map their
own schema
>or
>whether the SDD schema is being proposed as a schema for developers to
(partially) implement when designing applications
>and repositories for capturing descriptive data.

It is designed as a unifying standard, to allow lossless roundtripping
between applications. At the same time, we are struggling with how much
should be mandatory and how much optional (your second option)

>transparently.

On this I'm sure you're right, and we have had many discussions within SDD
about this problem. There are differing views as to the importance of
taxonomists themselves coming to grips with SDD, as the standard itself will
generally be invisible to a taxonomist using an SDD-compliant application.
[Paterson, Trevor]
The problem is that someone has to write and implement the applications (
e.g. me !) - and they have to do this in collaboration with taxonomists - or
it will be perceived as an irrelevant imposition - -therefore it will always
be necessary to get at least some  taxonomists from a variety of fields to
understand the schema...
>From my perspective actually it seems much easier for computer scientists to
get to grips with taxonomy rather than vice versa - ( although taxonmists
would be a bit defensive about this....)

Translation and multiple language representations: allowing multiple
languages is seen as a fundamental part of the SDD brief. Life would indeed
be much simpler if everyone spoke the same language, but they don't so we
need to handle that.

>It is not clear whether SDD proposes that a single document can include
multiple language representations, or whether these
>would form separate documents, conforming to the same standard

SDD can handle multiple language representations of every character string
within the one document.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Still not convinced allowing multiple language representations would mace
for good/accurate science

Multiple expertise levels

>I am similarly suspicious of the necessity for including the ability for
recording different expertise levels in one document format.

>[Again this would appear to be a political requirement??]

This is not a political requirement, but an attempt to broaden the
application of taxonomy beyond taxonomists (surely a requirement if the
taxonomic crisis is to be resolved). It also derives neatly from the XML
underpinning (XML is based on the idea of multiple representations of a
single document)
[Paterson, Trevor]
Yes I see where you are coming from - i think the probelm is that
taxonomists are concerned about accurate representation of their data for
their purposes - making a shareable version of this is not perceived as of
any value to them - they want a scientific tool to do their job - i am not
sure how /if we could encourage a dual markup approach  - or whether
different 'markets' for descriptive data would exist independently -

Defining the descriptive terminology

>Are you suggesting that the SDD Terminology Section will be adequate and
appropriate to store
>and represent any (allowed) defined terminology?

Yes, we hope so. Do you think it will be inadequate?
[Paterson, Trevor]
It probably would be adequate to store Prometheus terminologies  - with
minor tinkering, the semantics of the terminolgies could be saved just with
glossary entries and relationships etc - but would obviously require
interpetation by suitable applications. I cant understand concept trees well
enough to get a feel for whether they could store the semantics of a
terminolgy more explicitly.....
However, that is not to say SDD could cope with other terminolgies  that
might have further unforseen relationships - there might need to be a
facility for recording 'user defined' relationships such as our stategroup
membership and restrictions between these and sets of structures - i think
that these type of relationships are representable in concept trees - but
would need a primer/ turotial to show me how.

>Is the standard going to allow descriptions to reference other defined
terminologies?

It will be possible to outsource the terminology section, so if a group
creates a controlled vocabulary, that could be referenced in multiple SDD
documents. So presumably Prometheus could be the source of a controlled
vocabulary that other users (of they found it adequate) could reference.

>Would SDD only accept Data marked up in an SDD terminology?

Yes - or do I misunderstand this question?
[Paterson, Trevor]
If i understand your previous remark - you could have completely external
termnologies - that SDD 'knows' nothing about the structure and semantics -
so it would have to accept 'non-SDD' terminology

>Would existing terminologies have to be translated/mapped/redescribed in
SDD format?

Any existing terminology can be represented in SDD, so there will be no
remapping necessary.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Again this will only be knowable if people try doing it. Obviously if there
is a standard structure people would be encouraged to use it - but
prexisting description ontologies ( eg PlantOnology and GeneOntology) would
not want to retrofit to the standard....even if there is no ' rdesign or
remapping necessary - there is the matter of re-expressing it in an SDD
format

>Who is going to create terminologies, e.g.gusers on an adhoc basis, or
expert user groups?

As above, these may develop particularly for some groups (e.g. ferns,
legumes), but some users may choose to stay outside such a system (there
will be benefits and costs of using a controlled vocabulary, so people will
have to weigh it up for themselves). SDD itself is agnostic.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Almost our opinion - but we are not agnostic - we believe 'interpretability'
and 'reusability' are Gods, and we should proselytize on their behalfs -
gently of course - by offering only carrots and no sticks...

>Is it an aim to promote re-use and sharing of terminologies?

It would be a desirable outcome, but we hope it evolves bottom-up rather
than being imposed top-down.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Sure

>Is there going to be policing of SDD terminologies, e.g. maintaining
versioning, additions etc?

Versioning will be handled within SDD, but there can be no possibility of
policing a system
[Paterson, Trevor]
This what really worries the taxonomists - imposed standards reducing the
flexibility and expressivity of their descriptions - and hatred of a police
state. I think standardisation WILL be perceived to lead to a loss of
expressivity - but as often one person's expressivity is another'; s
incomprehensivity to an outsider this seems like potentially 'a good thing'
( in small doses obviously)........


>How was the terminology section created - by examining examples of
terminology specifications,
>ontology representations etc?

We have had a mix of off-the-top-of-the-head speculation as to how best to
do things, and proofing of concepts against real-world examples. I would
have liked to see more proofing going on during development, but this has
been hard to maintain, and may be to our cost. We are nbow at a phase where
several groups are trting to implement SDD-compliance for their systems -
this will be the proof of the pudding.

Note also that SDD is currently v0.9 - with the explicit statement on
release that everything may change if we find that the proofing fails.

>Does it form a standard template for storing a terminology?

What do you mean by this. It provides the standard schema for representing
an (undefined) terminology.

>Is it compatible with any existing tools, standards or formats - e.g.
ontology editors?

We have specifically made it very general. There is currently no existing
tool that can handle SDD. Hopefull this will change shortly.
[Paterson, Trevor]
Keep me posted

----------------------------------
So does Prometheus have any data yet, or is it still at the model stage? It
would be very interesting to try representing Prometheus data in SDD.
[Paterson, Trevor] to date  we have
the model ( and a data base implementation to save model compliant data)
a tool for creating simple terminologies -  with definitions, PartOf,
Typeof, Stategroup relations etc
a prototype angiosperm terminology/ontology
a prototype tool for using onologies to specify project description
templates ( proformas)
which also allows recordng of specimen descriptions
the ability to save these descriptions to the database in the model
compliant format
and we are currently getting user testing done on the prototype by the
taxonomists, who are making proformas adn saving specimen descriptions. We
are just about ready to use the tool for a 'real' project if we can get time
and interest to do this...eg for a small taxonomic revision. We are rapidly
approaching the end of our project funding however.. so it may switch to
being a 'back burner' project....

Subject: SDD Schema in relationship to Prometheus


Gregor

I have written a rough document considering several aspects of the
SDD-schema - largely interpreted with reference to our Prometheus Database
model for descriptive data. It seems easier to keep this all together,
rather than post it to various sections on twiki, so i am attaching it here

My main problems in interpreting the schema were the lack of documentation
( as always...) especially for the conceptually complex parts like concept
trees. I think clear, visual  summary models for description, characters,
concept trees etc would help a novice to get to grips with the concepts, and
might make some of the complexities more tractable. I do worry that the
overall schema is over complex and 'trying to do too much in one go' - eg
considering multiple language and expertise representations, although I am
sure that there are good political reasons for everything.....

Hi Kevin
=20
looking over the character lists you use for keys I would say that they =
can
all be expressed by decomposing into a number of atomic statements ( =
our
angiosperm ontology has not yet included some of the structures and =
states
required, but this is not a problem as the terminology is readily
expandable) - i have briefly outlined the sort of mapping that is done =
in
the table below,=20
(note - i am not a botanist...so there may be some gaffs ;-).

The approach that we are proposing is that the descriptions are =
collected as
atomic statements, and more traditional 'characters' can be discovered =
by
analysis of this data (many characters are apparently a collection of =
atomic
scores/states)

Our taxonomists find this quite a departure from how they compose and =
record
their characters at the moment ( they recognize/discover and define a =
set of
characters by looking at the variation that exists in their specimen, =
then
create a scoring sheet/proforma that allows them to pick one of these
alternative characters) -  our system might be tweaked to allow them to =
work
in a more character oriented manner if they precompose sets of =
statements as
part of the proforma specification, and then score these alternates as
present or absent.

a major advantage of our system can be seen from some of your simple
characters - eg growth habit: you have split this into two alternatives =
1.
Epiphytic or lithophytic habit vs  2. (not epiphytic or lithophytic) =
whilst
this might make sense for a key, and is a DELTA-like representation, we
would argue that if the ACTUAL growth habit was scored for each =
specimen as
epiphytic, lithophytic, terrestrial, aquatic  ( or concatenations of =
these )
far more accurate information would be recorded. For example, this =
would
allow the same specimen description to be divided into other character =
sets
if desired ( someone else may think that a key would work better if the
alternates were soildwelling or lithophytic vs epiphytic, another =
person
might want the alternates separately....if the description data had =
been
recorded in the orginal two-alternate-character division, this data =
reuse
would not be possible.

I hope this shows some of the salient features of our model...and how =
we
think it would beneft working taxonomists.

would say that they can all be expressed by decomposing into a number =

statements ( our angiosperm ontology has not yet included some of the =
structures=20

'characters' can be discovered by analysis of this data (many =
characters are=20
apparently a collection of atomic scores/states)<BR><BR>Our taxonomists =
find=20
this quite a departure from how they compose and record their =
characters at the=20
moment ( they recognize/discover and define a set of characters by =
looking at=20
the variation that exists in their specimen, then create a scoring=20
sheet/proforma that allows them to pick one of these&nbsp; alternative=20
characters) -&nbsp; our system might be tweaked to allow them to work =
in a more=20
character oriented manner if they precompose sets of statements as part =
of the=20
proforma specification, and then score these alternates as present or=20
absent.<BR><BR>a major advantage of our system can be seen from some of =
your=20
simple characters - eg growth habit: you have split this into two =
alternatives=20
1. Epiphytic or lithophytic habit vs&nbsp; 2. (not epiphytic or =
lithophytic)=20
whilst this might make sense for a key, and is a DELTA-like =
representation, we=20
would argue that if the ACTUAL growth habit was scored for each =
specimen as=20
epiphytic, lithophytic, terrestrial, aquatic &nbsp;( or concatenations =
of these=20
) far more accurate information would be recorded. For example, this =
would allow=20
the same specimen description to be divided into other character sets =
if desired=20
( someone else may think that a key would work better if the alternates =
were=20
soildwelling or lithophytic vs epiphytic, another person might want the =

alternates separately....if the description data had been recorded in =
the=20

possible.</FONT><BR></FONT></DIV>

you<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;get back can still be interpreted in the same way. =

is,<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;you would need<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;to check whether the =

Trevor - thanks very much for your comments =
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;comparative=20
document -<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;this is really useful, and we need to get =
much more=20
feedback<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;like this.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;The =
main=20
difference between SDD and Prometheus seems to be<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;that =
you=20
are<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;working specifically on the basis of defining a=20
controlled<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;terminology<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;whereas SDD =
explicitly=20
decided early on that a controlled<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;terminology=20
was<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;outside our scope. History will judge which approach =
is=20
best.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;[Paterson, Trevor]<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;a controlled =
terminology=20
was not such a large feature of our work<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;initially - we =
were more=20
interested in the model for=20
saving<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;'character'<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;data - however it =
became=20
obvious that the only way to=20
allow<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;unambiguous<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;interpretation of =
data&nbsp; -=20
for reuse, comparison etc - was to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;provide=20
full<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;definitions. it then seemed desirable that people=20
would<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;share definitions to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;allow=20
compatability.......whether this will be achieved by bottom=20
up<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;adoption is an open question. Taxonomists don seem to =

like<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;the idea of top<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;down imposition - =
tho they=20
may be happier when it is<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;restricted to quite=20
a<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;small domain of =
users<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;We did=20
have early discussions about a controlled =
terminology<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;(see the=20
list<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;archives for a history of this).One dificulty for =
us is=20
that<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;SDD is designed<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;to be biology-wide =
(indeed,=20
we have even removed specific<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;references=20
to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;biology, such as "taxon", because SDD is equally=20
applicable<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;to descriptions<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;of non-taxa =
such as=20
diseases, nutrient deficiency syndromes,<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;soils=20
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;minerals. Perhaps here we have drawn our bow too =
wide,=20
but<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;we were informed<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;by the fact that at =
our=20
Lisbon meeting all but one of the<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;contributors=20
who<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;were working with identification tools had removed=20
their<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;biology-specific<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;tags to become =
more=20
general). Prometheus (as I understand it<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;from=20
your<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;document) is specifically botanical. This would be =
an=20
intolerable<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;restriction for us given our=20
brief.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;[Paterson, Trevor]<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;We are =
constrained by=20
the expertise of whoever we are<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;collaborating=20
with...<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;the taxonomists at RBGE are full partners in =
this project=20
so<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;the 'test<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;domains' reflect their=20
interests&nbsp; and expertise ( or we will<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;never get=20
real<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;test data). We hope that our character model will=20
be<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;applicable to the whole<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;field of =
biological=20
taxonomy - - and that=20
specific<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;ontologies/terminologies<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;could =
be=20
developed to allow description of other groups =
(<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;mammals,=20
insects<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;etc)<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously, a =

botany-wide controlled terminology is more<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;achievable =
than=20
a<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;biology-wide one. Personally, however, I think that =
you=20
run<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;the danger even<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;in botany with any =
controlled=20
terminology of trying to force<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;nature =
kicking<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;and=20
screaming into small boxes, and do it an =
injustice<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;therewith. I=20
don't<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;know how any botany-wide controlled terminology =
could=20
cope<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;with the leaves<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;of Drosera =
auriculata, for=20
instance, or the morphology of<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Podostemaceae.=20
(In<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;fact, I wonder whether the dream of a controlled=20
terminology<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;is more likely<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;in a cold =
Northern=20
Hemisphere climate than in the biodiverse South=20
or<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;tropics?).<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;[Paterson,=20
Trevor]<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes - we know that diverse taxa would probably=20
require<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;specific ontologies.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;We may be =
able to=20
develope a system that allows a core<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;central terminology =

-<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;with taxon specific extensions.....We want to=20
allow<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;MEANINGFUL&nbsp; comparison<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;of data =
- and=20
often there is no need or sense in comparing<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;data=20
across<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;widely divergent taxa&nbsp; ie you would might =
want to=20
compare<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;the properties of<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;stalks on =
angiosperm=20
flowers, but it is probably of no<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;taxonomic interest=20
to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;compare these with the stalks of a slime mould=20
fruiting<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;body...............<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&=
gt;In=20
general, we have taken the view that a controlled terminology=20
in<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;particular domains (e.g. legumes) may develop as an=20
emergent<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;property of<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;SDD, rather than =
imposed=20

specific points from your =

SDD was scoped to be a superset of existing systems =

field=20
can<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;envisage but no-one's<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;really done yet =

(particularly federation issues - and you<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;may be=20
further<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;down this track than we are). This is part of =
the reason=20
for<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;the =
complexity,<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is not=20
clear to me whether SDD is proposing this schema =
as<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a=20
unifying schema to which different description =
formats<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;would map=20
their<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;own =
schema<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whether=20
the SDD schema is being proposed as a schema =
for<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;developers=20
to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;(partially) implement when designing=20
applications<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and repositories for capturing =
descriptive=20
data.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;It is designed as a unifying =
standard, to=20
allow lossless<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;roundtripping<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;between =
applications.=20
At the same time, we are struggling<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;with how=20
much<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;should be mandatory and how much optional (your =
second=20
option)<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From our own collaborative=20
experiences with botanical<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;taxonomists,=20
data<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;models and structures hold no interest to them=20
in<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practice, and they find even our simple =
conceptual model=20
of<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;character<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;description complex to =
understand.=20
Probably few working<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;taxonomists would wish to =
interact at=20
any level with the<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;SDD schema =
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;applications=20
would have to achieve this=20
mapping<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;transparently.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt=
;On this=20
I'm sure you're right, and we have had many<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;discussions =
within=20
SDD<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;about this problem. There are differing views as to =
the=20
importance of<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;taxonomists themselves coming to grips =
with SDD, as=20
the<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;standard itself will<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;generally be =
invisible to=20
a taxonomist using an<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;SDD-compliant=20
application.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;[Paterson, Trevor]<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;The =
problem is=20
that someone has to write and implement the<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;applications =

(<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;e.g. me !) - and they have to do this in collaboration =

with<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;taxonomists - or<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;it will be =
perceived as an=20
irrelevant imposition -<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;-therefore it will=20
always<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;be necessary to get at least some&nbsp; =
taxonomists from=20
a<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;variety of fields to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;understand the=20
schema...<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;From my perspective actually it seems much =
easier=20
for<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;computer scientists to<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;get to grips =

this....)<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation and multiple =

(Note: I am trying to split the discussion "SDD Schema in
relationship to Prometheus_Response to Kevin"; please respond to
this).

I am very interested in how well this can be achieved. The character
hierarchies contain enumerated attributes that attempt to describe
what kind of hierarchy a given tree represents. This may be a purely
presentational hierarchy, or a part/structure, a property, a method.
Please compare ConceptTreeDefType/Type with enumerated list in the
schema. Is this appropriate/sufficient?

I addition to these we have all the time recognized the need for more
exact definition of descriptive objects, and we call the objects that
should achieve this Glossary/GlossaryEntries. Despite being within
terminology, and next to characters they can be used fully separate
to describe

Two of Trevor's questions in the word document regarding the Glossary
were:

1. "I am also unsure as to how well defined the terminology MUST be
within SDD (e.g. does a glossary entry require a definition and
authority - or could bare words with no definition or relation ship
to other terms be included)"

2. "I am still quite confused about HOW PRECISELY a terminology CAN
be defined within a SDD document. e.g. how accurately can a term be
defined in terms of relationships with others, I understand that
these relationships are captured by the concept trees, although again
a (visual) model detailing this would clarify."

Ad 1: Glossary entries are always optional, otherwise it would be
impossible to express DELTA / Lucid / etc. legacy data in SDD. If a
glossary entry exists, it currently must provide a head term
(formalated independently, and perhaps redundantly from the
character, state, modifier, hierarchical concept etc. it refers to)
and either of a free-form text definition or a URI pointing to such a
definition on the web. The "ontological" relationships are optional.
The assumption is that a glossary will "grow" over time while a
project matures.

(Trevor: your argument about rigorous definition of data is quite
valid. I would assume that either the application controls that, or
that somebody derives a local version of the SDD schema for fully
schema driven data entry. However, quality enforcement can not be an
issue for a schema focussing on data exchange. We enforce
completeness questions only if we believe not doing so would break
application interoperability. We do rigourously enforce consistency
questions such as that a state must be defined before using it).

Ad 2. I cannot answer this, other than that we try to provide both
operational and ontological/fundamental means of expression. We
believe that much can be expressed, but these are only our scenarios.
Thus:

TO ALL: Please do provide scenarios you would like to try to express,
which you think may be difficult. We urgently need such examples!

I am rather worried about the relationship between these two
mechanisms in SDD. I believe there is a very good point in separating
fundamental ontology from operational definitions, in fact given our
task to be able to also represent legacy data (including printed
information) it is unavoidable.

However, there is clearly much overlap in creating character
hierarchies expressing a part-hierarchy, and having an unconstrained
method to express any part hierarchy in the Glossary/*/PartOf method.
One current result of this is, that we are not yet expressing
Property/State relations in Glossary; these only exist because
Glossary and Character/states may be linked. It would probably be a
good idea to separate them as well. Any opinions on that?

I believe when you say "character" in the above you mean what in
DELTA and SDD is considered a character "state"; is that correct? Do
you consider the states to be completely unrelated, i.e. green and
red and hairy and present are all on the same level? Or is this the
collection of state the property or type? This is something I don't
yet understand.

In many aspects, SDD and DELTA treat states are potentially
independent, i.e. characters have semantics, but are otherwise sets
of states. The important deviation is the coding status itself, which
always applies to the entire character.

Can you say in your model that a property is inapplicable or unknown?

I think potentially the point your are making is very important, i.e.
that for some (not all) "state sets" there may be different
partitionings motivated by different goals. One potentially can split
color into metallic colors, bright colors, earthen/brownish colors.

However, I think the example above is not well choosen (I assume you
refer to Kevin's General habit and Epiphytic or lithophytic habit. It
is quite possible to have combinations of these. Epiphytic plants may
be climber, herb, or grass- or sedge-like plant.

(Further thoughts on problems I see in structural decompositions).

The main unknown problem I see is how to express variability and lack
or uncertainty of knowledge about structural observations. This may
be exceptional in the extremely well studied higher plants, but not
so in small organisms that are often only imperfectly studied yet.

An example is "Chlorophyll in stems or leaves". You basically suggest
reformulating it to fit a given model that is considered more
effective for identification. In higher plants the assumption would
be that since the information is not available in the combined
statement, this involves some literature research, and perhaps
looking at a herbarium specimen. However, already in higher plants in
a key to families this is far from trivial, and in many organism
groups this imprecise synthetic statement may be the only knowledge
available.

Very similar case occur very frequently for temporal or spatial
modifications (which may be "regions" or not).

Also, I think you suggest in addition to Leaf-Cholorphyll Presence
and Stem-Chlorophyll Presence
to have:

Entire Plant - Colour - specify any colour

Which I believe would truly have to be above-ground vegetative parts
(I assume that the root color would not be considered, although roots
are included in entire plant). Providing these combined sub-
partitions (do you do that in the Prometheus model?) is necessarily a
choice among multiple combinations possible (for vascular bundle
characters combining root and stem may be desirable) that can not be
fit into a single hierarchy (do you provide multiple hierarchies?).

I do agree that better structured models have analytical advantages.
So far our believe is that currently no better model is well tested
and that limitations in the  range of possible statements (which
naturally do exist in the SDD model as well) need careful
consideration and testing. In that case the attempt of Prometheus to
do exactly such testing (i.e. not only to design an ontology model,
but record data and test its use in identification processes is
extremely valuable for the future.

My own goal would be to allow less structured descriptions being
expressed in SDD, but to support working ("voluntarily") in a model
that is highly and systematically structured. Applications may have
"modes" for rigourous or lenient behavior, but not the exchange
format.

Subject:      Fungi database structure - survey

Dear all,

I am working in the Bioiformatics Center as a librarian. I am pursuing my
ph.d. in LIS and its contribution in the field Biodiversity informatics. I
have conducted a survey of information needs of mycologist. I would
appreciate if you go through the following URL and help me in getting the
information for the database structure.

http://bioinfo.ernet.in/library/fungi/survey.htm

OR

http://shubha.0catch.com


These URLs have word file of my survey. I would appreciate if you go
through it and send me the filled questionnaire at

shubha@bioinfo.ernet.in / shubhanagarkar@netscape.net /
shubha_nagarkar@hotmail.com

Thanking you in advance.

Sincerely

Well, I hesitate to stick my neck out and into the space of this august,
expert group, but there hasn't been enough news from Iraq recently, so
here's something to ponder.

Bryan Heidorn visited Kansas this week and we had a discussion about
where TDWG-SDD is going, and the history of your deliberations.  We at
Kansas have not been involved with character data (although I have the
original interactive key program for plants (IDENT4) archived on paper
tape for the TDWG-SDD museum), but our recent SEEK project
(http://seek.ecoinformatics.org), with which I see there has been some
interaction with SDD, is attempting to build a global infrastructure for
handling, resolving and communicating taxonomic concepts (as opposed to
taxonomic names). =20

Bryan described to us how your schema is intended in include all of the
data and metadata associated with a diagnostic character set for a group
of taxa. My understanding is thus incomplete and based only on our
single discussion, but it struck me that TDWG-SDD has an opportunity to
have much broader acceptance and support if your schema was not designed
as a single data object--to contain both the metadata about the package
(or work or whatever you refer to it as) *and* the descriptive data that
describe the individual concepts.

If the taxa/concepts had their own schemas and were linked to the
package metadata with a GUID, maybe a DOI or some other globally unique
identifier, then the XML concept data sets could be used for other
systems like concept based classification or database management
systems.  This would in theory, and in my view, give the work of your
group much more leverage, exposure and relevance to a broader group of
scientists and users of names and concepts.

The overhead for the traditional diagnostic identification software
makers would be that the XML parts would need to assembled for the
various applications that use the data and there would be the potential
risk that SDD data sets would be incomplete, if there were some careless
file management.  But presumably you guys are thinking about a registry
or distributed federation of these data sets anyway, where they would be
archived and served intact from a trusted source.

I also understand that data sets of diagnostic identification
information are far from complete descriptions of concepts in either a
taxonomic or phylogenetic sense, but if the SDD concept schema could
accommodate additional characters, then the opportunity would be there
for other people to use SDD for other kinds of systems.  The UI of
diagnostic key programs would likely not need to use or display DNA
sequences for interactive identification, but no harm done, they could
just ignore fields of no use to the program at hand.

Another objection I anticipate would be that broadening SDD to
accommodate the functional requirements of the broader taxon concept
management objectives would make the SDD schema too complex and
difficult for anyone to work with.

Overall, it seems to this SDD-novice, that the mechanical overhead of
applications having to assemble the taxon/concept pieces with the
character definition and package metadata, would not so onerous that it
would outweigh the benefit of separating out the taxon/concept schema as
data sets that *could* standalone if someone wanted to use them that
way.

Respond if you dare.

Another novice (pre-novice) here, are you specifically referring to
separating out taxonomic concept information (metadata) from the
descriptive data?

Could you write this sentence with a few more words?  I'm want to be sure I
get the concept.

What parts could get lost? the taxonomic parts?

Um, now I am really lost, amplify please? What does this have to do with
incomplete SDD data sets?  More on dataset archives in the next email.

Ok, now we are getting to something I know about.  See the next email for
some comments on this...

TDWG-SDD folk:

One more thought which I should have mentioned, the SEEK project is
working with GBIF through Jesse Kennedy's Napier University lab on a
SEEK concept schema with the objective supporting concept-based
databases, IR of concepts and other fun stuff such as web-based services
for concept identification, resolution and disambiguation.  I believe
Jessie plans to present that schema at the TDWG meeting this year.=20

I guess the logical end point of my argument would be that the two
standards might become one, so that taxonomic concepts could be used by
both groups of scientists from a single schema.

It seems inevitable that GBIF, SEEK, Berlin, or whomever will put
together a satisfactory, implementable, concept schema within the next
year or two.  My only thought is that the SDD standard might, with what
seems to be a pretty minor shift in organization, be part of the broader
concept effort.

Excuse, if you all have been through this discussion N times!

Jim B.

Jim questions/comments encouraged me to bring up a somewhat related
question about SDD.

I am involved in a project to provide a variety of tools for
collaboratively creating, managing and annotating digital morphological
(DM) data.  By and large, DM means pixel and voxel (mostly voxel) data
derived from various tomographic instrumentation, but the system will also
allow collection and storage of scanned illustrations or even just words
and numbers.  My initial inclination for such a system (at its most basic,
a taxon by character matrix) was that it primarily served as a tool for
collaborative building of matrices for phylogenetic analysis (but allowing
all to see the actual character states rather than simply a terse word
description), but quickly it became obvious that some folks might store
regular descriptive data. Thus, I started thinking about how this would
communicate with a variety of outside tools:  tree building (Nexus), keys
(Delta, SDD), etc.

The system will also effectively act as an archive for published data sets
(not in the formal sense at this point, but simply because the data reside
in a network accessible database) with the added advantage of users being
able to actually see and interact with the data that produced the
conclusions seen in a paper.

The point of this long introduction is that I want to reinforce the idea
that SDD concept schema should be broad enough to accommodate  additional
character types, including not only sequence/protein/gene data but digital
proxies of a variety of morphological data types as well.  The "dentary" in
a voxel data set might be represented by a database structure that encodes
which voxels in a tomographic data brick belong to that particularly
structure.  If I need to pass this information on to an interactive
identification tool, will SDD have a schema for passing the information?

Looking for magic bullets....

No, I was thinking of seperating the metadata about the package "This is a
data set of Magnolias from FNA, it was assembled by, organized by, dates,
etc.) from the data describing the character states of the individual
taxa.  So a good question is what do you do with the character
definitions! It seems the character state values without the character
definitions would not be of much use for any system to interpret the
meaning of the states.  Two options, de-normalize the character
definitions and put them in each concept schema, or two have a separate
server, and an external reference in the data schema that, has the
character definitions. Not sure how that choice would play out.

How about an ASCII graphic?  I'm on thin ice, but if the metadata for the
package is this:

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

and the individual taxon character state sets are this:

taxon1       taxon2      taxon3
char-val-1   char-val-1  etc.
char-val-2   etc.
char-val-3

if the taxon data sets (and maybe also their character definitions)we in
sperate XML documents, then we could use them as fodder for other concept
systems.

yes, if you had multiple xml docs for the same 'diagnostic package' they
would be managed as distinct files.

People serving SDD data sets thorugh the web, would presumably be aware of
data set integrity issues and make sure their SDD packages were complete.

Hi Jim!

Actually this expert group is small and struggling with a complex
design.

Too few people have the time either to penetrate it and find the
critical points still lacking, or to write comprehensive
documentation.

Any contributions are most welcome!

.... and as I see it, the most valuable tax. concepts are not based on
synonymy or specimen lists, but on comprehensive descriptions.

.... which makes me critical of the current lack of providing name
identifiers separately from taxon concept identifiers. To describe a
new concept in SDD we need name, not concept IDs... But this is a
GBIF ECAT issue...

This is right into the heart of our discussions. We absolutely do NOT
want to define names, we want to use them. You may say link to them.
The current schema contains a general attempt to link to external
resources, including specimens and taxonomic names. See
Entities/Objects and Entities/Classes in the schema.

We call these objects ResourceConnectors. Each connector has an
external ID, a provider, and a human-readable text representation. In
addition, the derived connector types may add additional information.

The name "ResourceConnector" may be vague or confusing. In a way, it
is intended as a proxy design pattern, each connector stands as a
proxy object for a external object, the link to which may be
temporarily unavailable. Any suggestions what better name to call
this?

Rather struggling with UDDI... I am still confused what, besides a
UDDI URL should be stored to reproducible retrieve a service wsdl URI
(that may change over time, thus the use of a UDDI). UDDI is defined
extremely general, too general for me.

Also, we would need to develop interface definitions containing a set
of standard operations to retrieve lists of external objects to make
a selection from, or to retrieve rich information about an external
object (i.e. more than the proxy inside SDD saves. I believe this is
essential for the future of GBIF but wonder where the resources are
to tackle these problems...

I believe this is a misunderstanding. SDD is in no ways confined to
diagnostic sets, if diagnostic is understood as a minimized set of
field-observable characters. That may work for plants, it does not
work for fungi or other microorganisms.

We do attempt to provide means to differentiate between different
kind of characters. One method is that concept trees point to the
characters, and the method tree contains different methods. Another
is an attempt to allow ratings to rate characters and concepts (the
characters would inherit from concepts) for
  identification convenience,
  identification availability,
  identification reliability of feature

DELTA had a simple character wheight. Problem with that is that it
had no semantics other than change it until your selected program
produces a desired result.

Any comments or experience with this?

No, I think that is where SDD has to go. I guess difficult is where
we are already... We try to break it up into modular components to
show that SDD tackles a range of problems, and that smaller subsets
of SDD are available for individual problems.

Can you provide some ideas about how you would modularize the data,
with just a keyword /example list of things in each module. I think
without you looking in detail at the schema, such a list might be
very valuable to the development of SDD!

Thanks a lot!

This is on our agenda, but I am stuggling how to do it.

What we already know is: SDD can have a project that only defines
terminology. We anticipate that other projects containing
descriptions would like to use a common terminology project. Perhaps
even better: select blocks from multiple such projects.

The problem is how to organize this. One problem is technical: the
xml schema identity constraints only work within a single file, which
I think is a stupid design bug in xml schema.

The second problem is that the obvious solution would be to use some
kind of xinclude that inserts one file into another. We would need
inserting fragments, or split the terminology exactly at some "block
level" (modules of several characters or concepts) into files.

My experience is that xml tools do not support xinclude. I mostly
work with xml spy, and I could not get it to work. Does anybody have
experience how this modular design can be solved with current tools,
so that we can do some testing?

Which examples exist that have a similar modular structure, but still
use identifiers the referential integrity of which should be
validated?

What is a DOI?
Wouldn't I need more than the GUID information?

Currently we achieve GUIDs through combining a Project GUID with
local 32 bit integer IDs. I personally am a fan of the long GUIDs for
such purposes, but the majority prefers URI-type IDs.

The Project GUID is planned either to be a self-controlled URL, or a
registered Project name, e.g. registered through a GBIF UDDI.

Already asked above: should it really be files? Can we not have
fragment identifiers to point within files? What are the techniques
to do this?

Xlink?

Won't most of this happen at some kind of web service level?  Application
builders will need to know what schemas to draw on for different components
of their tools, but the complexity of the underlying documents shouldn't be
too much of a barrier.  On the other hand, maintaining referential
integrity (and resolving conflicting standards for similar concepts) across
multiple standards may be a real challenge.

Fundamentally, Jim's question about where to define "characters" addresses
this in a real world way.  For truly simple, widely accepted character
concepts either solution works, but where definitions diverge, both
solution have problems.  I think this has to be denormalized and rely on
data mining tools to rationalize equivalence of concepts across multiple
definitions of "flower color."

BTW, there is an interesting article on bioinformatic (my spell checker
suggests 'bondwoman, bookworm and bonbons' for bioinformatic!) databases
(focusing on PDB) in this weeks Nature.  They at least mention some of
these issues.

First,it is important to understand that there is NO schema for any
particular taxon, group of taxa, specimen, or any other thing or class
of things that an SDD document can describe--such as, diseases,
restaurants of Lawrence Kansas,  "Halcyon House Bed and Breakfast", or
avian pests of Boston, MA. Rather the SDD schema constrains how you make
descriptions, how you represent properties and values (i.e. characters
and states), howthose things can be related to one another, and how you
can make decision trees based on them, usually for identification purposes.

Bearing in mind that SDD is in its rev 0.9, which is a proposal not yet
adopted by TDWG, in its "Terminology" section, SDD provides for both
"global" and "local" states, the former applicable  to any characters
that wishes to use them. Examples might be various colors, shape terms
like "ovate", etc. Consuming applications are invited to use a semantics
in which global states are identical no matter where used. (For local
states this is not a meaningful question in SDD. ). Characters and
states in an SDD document do not get a GUID (though it sounds worth
considering), so documents that do not use the same Terminology section
can't compare characters or states in any defined way. Also the only
mechanism on the table for sharing Terminology across instance documents
is by XML inclusion, and this is not really a persistant mechanism
suitable for integration. In the present version, it is generally
expected that all the Terminology is defined if not in the document,
then in something that accompanies it, thus finessing the issue. Put
another way, SDD's first design target was data exchange, not data
integration, with informal attempt to keep in view where the issues may
be to migrate to support of integrating applications. Put yet another
way, to reliably use an SDD0.9 instance refering to shared external
Terminology requires a contract between all such instances that the
external Terminology is the same. SDD0.9 itself provides no mechanisms
for representing or enforcing such a contract, nor a mechanism for
expressing a fallback position if an application can represent and
detect such a violation. (Though at most expected places, SDD provides
for application-specific data to be inserted of which applications can
make whatever meaning they wish). I don't doubt that it is easy to
replace inclusion with a reference to a shared Terminolgy acquired
through a registry and accessed by a GUID or DOI. I'm certain that the
only issue would be what to do if the Terminology is in fact
unacquirable, and that issue is orthogonal to all the structure issues
that SDD is meant to address.

The SDD committee welcomes both lurkers and contributers to the SDD
discussion Wiki http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/SDD/WebHome
There you can especially see what questions we wrestled with, and can
especially contribute questions we missed or comment on answers that are
less than helpful in other contexts where we missed a chance to contribute.

We expect there will be an SDD workshop before TDWG in Christ Church and
hope that well before then there will be several implementations to study.

To this point we avoided the character naming issue, I think in part=20
because of the controversy that is associated with his issue. The general=20
external reference mechanism described in Gregor's later post, is an=20
attempt to push off that controversy, in part to a system outside of SDD.=20
That does have the advantage of simplifying SDD a bit which is greatly=
 needed.

It might be worth considering how the character definition service might=20
actually work. Building on Jim's ideas, we could imagine a mechanism that=20
would allow anyone (with authority) to add definitions
and globally unique identifiers for the characters. It may beyond our=20
financial means now but there could be a service where one could send a=20
character / or state definition, including a current context of=20
application. It would be date stamped. Open to some very minimal revision=20
permission. New global ideas would need to be created is the definition=20
were changed or expanded. Of course the definition of a character might=20
need to refer to a other registered character groups, characters or states.

if GUCID is a global unique character ID
You might sent the registration service the following XML document and get=
=20
a GUCID back in return. Now any reference to this group in any species=20
description in earth could cite this GUCID as part of a description. In=20
this definition we could include GUCID references to the necessary=
 components.

<CharacterGroup>
   <CharacterGroupName name=3D"flowers"
GUCID=3Df???">
<Context>angiosperms</Context>
flowers</CharacterGroupName>
<LegalValue name=3D"inflorescence_position" GUCID=3D"1ej48dhk"></LegalValue>
<LegalValue name=3D"inflorescence_type" GUCID=3DNSNJKNDJBY248N"></LegalValue=

    <Synonym></Synonym>
    <BroaderTerm></BroaderTerm>
    <NarrowerTerm></NarrowerTerm>
    <RelatedTerm></RelatedTerm>
</CharacterGroup>

using a collection of character definitions defined outside you could have=
=20
a stand alone description. Given two taxonomic descriptions, you could=20
decide if they are using the same definitions for their characters by=20
looking at the GUCIDs. I well formed character matrix could be constructed=
=20
from the intersection of like characters in a collection of taxonomic=20
descriptions. I well organized project might want to decide which=20
characters to use ahead of the building the descriptions to make sure there=
=20
are not too many conflicts in the definitions. Perhaps context would help=20
with some of the conflicts.

Not that two projects could use the word "flower" to mean two completely=20
different things, and a computer programs could know this because they=20
would have different GUCIDs

There is no reason not to create character types and registration to handle=
=20
gene sequences or whatever. I think this is already covered very well  in=20
SDD. In fact, I think the character definition section of SDD could be used=
=20
almost exactly the way it is now except that we would rely on the existence=
=20
of the global character registry.


I know this is a bit radical and maybe heavy handed but i do not think it=20
is all that difficult given the structures already in SDD.

I think we would still need the certainty mechanisms in SDD to support the=
=20
certainty or prevalence of a character/state within an individual species=20
or taxon. (almost always red flowers.)

I think the registration of the individual taxonomic descriptions is=20
another very parallel issue. Relatively easy to do either as collections of=
=20
treatments as are now in SDD or as standalone treatments with globally=20
defined character sets.

No, I was thinking of seperating the metadata about the package
&quot;This is a<br>
data set of Magnolias from FNA, it was assembled by, organized by,
dates,<br>
etc.) from the data describing the character states of the
individual<br>
taxa.&nbsp; So a good question is what do you do with the character<br>
definitions! It seems the character state values without the
character<br>
definitions would not be of much use for any system to interpret=20
the<br>
meaning of the states.&nbsp; Two options, de-normalize the=20
character<br>
definitions and put them in each concept schema, or two have a
separate<br>
server, and an external reference in the data schema that, has the<br>
character definitions. Not sure how that choice would play
out.</blockquote><br>
To this point we avoided the character naming issue, I think in part
because of the controversy that is associated with his issue. The general
external reference mechanism described in Gregor's later post, is an
attempt to push off that controversy, in part to a system outside of SDD.
That does have the advantage of simplifying SDD a bit which is greatly
needed.<br><br>
It might be worth considering how the character definition service might
actually work. Building on Jim's ideas, we could imagine a mechanism that
would allow anyone (with authority) to add definitions <br>
and globally unique identifiers for the characters. It may beyond our
financial means now but there could be a service where one could send a
character / or state definition, including a current context of
application. It would be date stamped. Open to some very minimal revision
permission. New global ideas would need to be created is the definition
were changed or expanded. Of course the definition of a character might
need to refer to a other registered character groups, characters or
states.<br><br>
if GUCID is a global unique character ID<br>
You might sent the registration service the following XML document and
get a GUCID back in return. Now any reference to this group in any
species description in earth could cite this GUCID as part of a
description. In this definition we could include GUCID references to the
necessary components.<br><br>
&lt;CharacterGroup&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;<b>CharacterGroupName name=3D&quot;flowers&quot;</b> <br>
GUCID=3Df???&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;Context&gt;angiosperms&lt;/Context&gt;<br>
flowers&lt;/CharacterGroupName&gt;<br>
&lt;LegalValue name=3D&quot;inflorescence_position&quot;
GUCID=3D&quot;1ej48dhk&quot;&gt;&lt;/LegalValue&gt;<br>
&lt;LegalValue name=3D&quot;inflorescence_type&quot;
GUCID=3DNSNJKNDJBY248N&quot;&gt;&lt;/LegalValue&gt;<br>
=85 Many more here =85<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Synonym&gt;&lt;/Synonym&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BroaderTerm&gt;&lt;/BroaderTerm&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;NarrowerTerm&gt;&lt;/NarrowerTerm&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RelatedTerm&gt;&lt;/RelatedTerm&gt;<br>
&lt;/CharacterGroup&gt;<br><br>
using a collection of character definitions defined outside you could
have a stand alone description. Given two taxonomic descriptions, you
could decide if they are using the same definitions for their characters
by looking at the GUCIDs. I well formed character matrix could be
constructed from the intersection of like characters in a collection of
taxonomic descriptions. I well organized project might want to decide
which characters to use ahead of the building the descriptions to make
sure there are not too many conflicts in the definitions. Perhaps context
would help with some of the conflicts.<br><br>
Not that two projects could use the word &quot;flower&quot; to mean two
completely different things, and a computer programs could know this
because they would have different GUCIDs<br><br>
There is no reason not to create character types and registration to
handle gene sequences or whatever. I think this is already covered very
well&nbsp; in SDD. In fact, I think the character definition section of
SDD could be used almost exactly the way it is now except that we would
rely on the existence of the global character registry.<br><br>
<br>
I know this is a bit radical and maybe heavy handed but i do not think it
is all that difficult given the structures already in SDD.<br><br>
I think we would still need the certainty mechanisms in SDD to support
the certainty or prevalence of a character/state within an individual
species or taxon. (almost always red flowers.)<br><br>
<blockquote type=3Dcite class=3Dcite cite>&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;If the taxa/concepts had their own schemas and were linked to
the<br>
&gt;&gt;package metadata with a GUID, maybe a DOI or some other globally

other<br>

&gt;incomplete SDD data sets?&nbsp; More on dataset archives in the next
email.<br><br>
People serving SDD data sets thorugh the web, would presumably be aware
of<br>
data set integrity issues and make sure their SDD packages were
complete.</blockquote><br>
I think the registration of the individual taxonomic descriptions is
another very parallel issue. Relatively easy to do either as collections
of treatments as are now in SDD or as standalone treatments with globally
defined character sets.<br><br>

Hoping to entice critics to the SDD Wiki, I argue at
http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/SDD/ExternalTerminology that
GUIDs are not alone sufficient to address important issues arising from
separating character and state definitions from descriptions.

I know that the SDD team have already been considering these issues (in
conjunction with the ABCD team and others), but I would like to make the
following points reflecting my priorities here in GBIF.

1. It will certainly be beneficial to model the data elements from SDD
in such a way that they can be reused in other documents.  I would think
that this should ideally allow at least for the Terminology, Entities,
Descriptions and Keys elements to form independent schema elements which
could be used in other schemas.  We do not want the use of these
elements to be restricted just because they have been tightly bound to a
specific document schema.  The intention with the ABCD schema was in
part to start the development of a library of reusable XML biodiversity
data types (not just a fixed document structure).  I see much of the
current work of TDWG (and of GBIF) to be developing just such a library,
from which we can seek to compose a wide variety of top level document
structures (specimen/observation data, character tables, diagnostic
keys, taxonomic revisions, markup of legacy taxonomic literature like
the Biologia Centrali-Americana).

2. On the other hand, it does seem sensible to provide for the metadata
to be transferred with each data set so that ownership information,
usage restrictions, known limitations, etc. are not lost.  I would
therefore like to put effort into adopting or developing a top-level
document envelope suitable for all classes of biodiversity data
exchange.  This should include information on origin and ownership, data
transformation history, taxonomic, geographic and temporal coverage (as
appropriate) and any metadata necessary to allow processors to identify
the schema(s) in use for the actual data within the document.  The real
content should be separable for re-use in other contexts, but such a
metadata wrapper standard would bring us closer to automating the
manipulation of a wide range of content.  I have in mind here something
like the ABCD structure, with a top level DataSets wrapper containing a
number of different DataSet objects, each of which is made up of a set
of Units.  In effect the Units element would be a container for data
elements from SDD, ABCD, TDWG-Names, etc.  The DataSet-level elements
would provide a common metadata model for all of these documents.

I feel that we need a grand vision for how we will unify all of these
different schemas into an overall information model.  Consider the task
of developing a full taxonomic revision for a group using XML documents.
This would naturally include references to specimens underlying a
concept (external references to ABCD documents?), character data (SDD),
and nomenclatural data (TDWG-Names).  The goal should be for a processor
to be able to take such a document and treat it as an element within a
comprehensive electronic library of biodiversity data.  We will need
registries of the locations of different documents (with some form of
GUID for each document) and mechanisms for managing the cross-references
(taxon names, catalog numbers for specimens, author names, character
definitions, etc.).  Such an infrastructure would allow us to populate
our taxon concepts with all of the relevant information.

The new version of the Structured Descriptive Data schema (SDD 1.0
beta 2) is released and documented (... partially, primer and some
manual documents still need updating) on:

http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-
SDD/Minutes/2004NZ_schema/DocuOverview.html

We hope to get some feedback until the TDWG meeting in New Zealand in
autumn. Please feel free to use the WIKIs (linked from page above) at
your convenience to start discussions - no need to ask permission for
new topics. It would perhaps be useful if as many people as possible
could look at the minimal example file for coded descriptions,
http://160.45.63.11/Projects/TDWG-SDD/Minutes/2004NZ_schema/SDD-Test-
Min1.xml.

Aside: For a long time I was very reluctant to ignore the depth of
the topic in favor of creating something that would only replace
basic DELTA/Lucid/Nexus but not provide for at least part of the
requirements that have already been identified by DeltaAccess and the
DELTA 2 proposal.

However, I now believe that the proposed structures are able to deal
with these requirements. This to me means that the basic structures
are hopefully ok, and I see no problems in accepting proposals to
leave aways some parts of the schema in version 1.0, with a
perspective to add them later on - perhaps after more experience has
been gained with the schema. We would need proposals and discussions
to guide us in what should have 1.0 priority and what not, however.

Thanks!

Subject:      Globally Unique Identifier

I am a software developer at Landcare Research in New Zealand, where we are
developing a names taxonomic database and web service.  We are at present
deciding on a unique identifier that will identify a specific Name,
Specimen, Vernacular, Reference etc, and would like to add my comments.

We currently favour a GUID identifier for several reasons:

- it is guaranteed to be unique globally, and can be created anywhere,
anytime by any server or client machine
- it has no meaning as to where the data is physically located and will
there not confuse any user about this
- it is not as usable by the user as ids such as integers, and a meaningful
id can lead to confusion/errors
- most id mechanisms, especially URI/URN ids require a 'governing body' to
handle namespaces/urls to ensure every URN is unique, whereas a GUID is
always unique

I do think a URL of some kind would be useful for things such as global
searches of multiple databases, as this will allow the search to go
directly to the data source where the name, referene, etc comes from.  But
this should not be part of its ID.  Maybe a name/id should have several
foms, a GUID for an ID and a URL + a GUID for a fully specified name.

What are the current thoughts on these ideas?

Hi Kevin,
In addition to other locations, there has been a lot of discussion about
the use of GUIDs in the SEEK project (seek.ecoinformatics.org) which is
also implementing a taxonomic name service and supporting the
development of a Taxonomic Information Exchange Standard (TIES?).

Some relevant discussion appears in the email archives of the taxon
sub-group of the SEEK project, e.g.
http://www.ecoinformatics.org/pipermail/seek-taxon/2004-May/thread.html

and also in the wiki pages for that part of the project:
http://seek.ecoinformatics.org/Wiki.jsp?page=SEEKTaxonCommunity

Additional locations to look are the wiki pages for the taxonomic
transfer schema: http://www.soc.napier.ac.uk/tdwg/index.php and pages
within that site such as
http://www.soc.napier.ac.uk/tdwg/index.php?pagename=GUID

The LSID (http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/lsid/) is currently
favored for implementing GUIDs for services such as this.

regards,
   Dave Vieglais

I am not quite sure, but to me it seems with "GUID" you refer to the
numeric, MAC-address generated GUID type. I have nothing against
these. However, any URN in my view is a GUID that has most of the
properties you mention:

The governing body is restricted to the primary web address, and in
most cases such an address is already available. Being a member of a
governmental institution that explicitly forbids the use without
prior consent, and forbids the use of its domain name once you are no
longer working for them, I realize some potential for problem.

A GUID is only part of the problem. The other half of the problem is
actually getting at the resource. URN schemes like DOI or LSID (I
prefer the latter) intend to define resolution mechanisms. That make
the URN not yet a URL - in my view the good comes with the good,
location and reorganization independence.

I believe GBIF should install such an LSID resolver, which is why in
the UBIF proxy model, under Links, I propose to support a general URL
(including potentially URNS), a typed LSID and a typed DOI. This
could be simplified to have just a URN (LSID and DOI are URNs), but
that would then require string parsing to determine and recognize the
preferred resolvable GUID types. Comments on splitting/not splitting
this are welcome!

There may be some need to define a non-resolvable URN/numeric GUID as
well. However, that would not be under the linking question. Is it
correct that linking requires resolvability, or am I thinking into a
wrong direction?

Dear Gregor,

Like you, I really like the potential of LSIDs.  They seem to offer
exactly the characteristics we need (and everyone I have met who has
looked closely at the alternatives seems to have come to the same
conclusion).  I want to hold a meeting as soon as possible to get input
(and buy-in) from the widest possible community and to resolve any
outstanding issues.  Then I want to get going with this as a
GBIF-supported model.

Thanks,

Donald

I am not quite sure, but to me it seems with "GUID" you refer to the
numeric, MAC-address generated GUID type. I have nothing against
these. However, any URN in my view is a GUID that has most of the

The governing body is restricted to the primary web address, and in
most cases such an address is already available. Being a member of a
governmental institution that explicitly forbids the use without
prior consent, and forbids the use of its domain name once you are no
longer working for them, I realize some potential for problem.

A GUID is only part of the problem. The other half of the problem is
actually getting at the resource. URN schemes like DOI or LSID (I
prefer the latter) intend to define resolution mechanisms. That make
the URN not yet a URL - in my view the good comes with the good,
location and reorganization independence.

I believe GBIF should install such an LSID resolver, which is why in
the UBIF proxy model, under Links, I propose to support a general URL
(including potentially URNS), a typed LSID and a typed DOI. This
could be simplified to have just a URN (LSID and DOI are URNs), but
that would then require string parsing to determine and recognize the
preferred resolvable GUID types. Comments on splitting/not splitting
this are welcome!

There may be some need to define a non-resolvable URN/numeric GUID as
well. However, that would not be under the linking question. Is it
correct that linking requires resolvability, or am I thinking into a
wrong direction?

It seems that DOI allows for any existing IDs to be used as part of the
unique identifier. That seems to me as a fast to adopt short term solution
but not a good idea for the long term. At first sight I very much liked the
LSID specification, but the longer I think about it, the less I like some
parts. What I think is missing in the LSID specification is that the unique
identifier should be 'meaningless' apart from being an identifier to become
time independent (and to avoid possible political problems). Any solution
with a URN I can think of has some meaning, which makes solutions like a
MAC-address generated GUID favorable in my opinion. And any meaning you need
(like an authority of an object) can be specified in metadata instead of
using it in the identifier. What is not very clear to me in the LSID
specification is where the LSID generated by a LSIDAssigningService is
actually stored.

This is precisely one of the key questions we need to address with any
identifier framework we adopt.  I think we could easily use LSIDs in a
way that should overcome your concerns, and I think that the built-in
mechanisms for discovery and metadata access within the LSID model are
really exciting.

I have just put together a PowerPoint presentation to explain some of
what I think we could achieve with globally unique identifiers and
particularly with LSIDS.  It can be downloaded from:

http://circa.gbif.net/Public/irc/gbif/dadi/library?l=/architecture/globa
llyuniqueidentifier/

It may be clearest if you go through it as a slide show rather than in
edit mode.

Thanks,

Donald

I want to start by wholeheartedly endorsing Wouter's plea for
non-information-bearing (meaningless) GUIDs.  This feature is CRITICAL to
the long-term success of any GUID system.  It is absolutely imperative that
there NEVER be any motivation to change the content of a GUID (i.e., it
should be permanent).  If the GUID itself contains any information
whatsoever, there may be motivation to change that information at a later
time.

For this reason, I had initially preferred the DOI approach, but over time,
I am gradually warming up to the LSID approach.  While components of an LSID
do, indeed, represent information, they represent the one piece of
information that I think may legitimately belong embedded within a GUID:
context.  That is, the context, or domain, of the GUID itself.  The context
in this case would be the "issuer" of the GUID -- not necessarily the
current "owner" of the GUID (see more discussion on this below).  Though the
organization that issued a GUID may eventually disappear, the fact that the
organization was the one to issue the GUID in the first place will never
change, and thus represents a permanent and unchanging component of the
GUID.  Without the context portion, the GUID itself is really nothing more
than a random string of characters.  In summary, I'm warming up to the LSID
approach because it represents embedded context, without the risk of
temptation to change the content of a GUID after it has been issued.

Regarding Donald's PPT file, I have a couple of comments and questions:
(Assumes Title slide is "Slide 1")

Slide 2:
You note there is "No reliable mechanism" to relate the same record from
different providers to each other.  But in the context of DarwinCore, the
combination of [InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] should
represent a virtual GUID (provided that the Global Provider Registry ensures
no duplication of [InstitutionCode]). I do realize that words like "should"
and "reliable" are critical here. Perhaps the DarwinCore implementation
should enforce the requirement of uniqueness of
[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] within a single [InstitutionCode], and
further ensure globally unique [InstitutionCode] values via the Global
Provider Registry.

Slide 3:
Wouldn't most of the problems indicated in the first four bulleted points be
largely solved by the Global Provider Registry? Using the [InstitutionCode]
would allow lookup in the registry for a (current/active) metadata URL, and
the metadata URL would provide information on where to access a particular
[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] piece of data.

The issue of specimens changing numbers and/or collections is problematic,
of course.

The issue of versioning is a bit dicey, in my mind (e.g., at what resolution
of information change)?  Some things, like changing taxonomic determinations
(i.e., "real" changes) need to be handled in a robust way.  Other things,
like the correction of typos and different styles of representing the exact
same information (e.g., R.L. Pile==>R.L. Pyle; or R.L. Pyle==>Pyle, R.L.)
probably don't need to be versioned.  Other sorts of changes (e.g., the
elaboration of previously existing information, such as the addition of
retroactively-generated georeference coordinates) fall somewhere in-between.

Slide 4:
We should all get behind SEEK in addressing these issues (Taxon concept
mapping). Ultimately, we minimally need a GUID pool for References
(inclusive of unpublished works), and a GUID pool for what I call
"Protonyms" (original creations of IC_N Code-compliant names).  The union of
these two GUIDs (what I would call "Assertions") would itself represent a
GUID to a "potential concept" (Berendsohn). (Note: my preference would be to
define Protonyms as a subtype of Assertions, and therefore Protonym GUIDs
would be a subset drawn from the same pool as Assertion GUIDs -- but this is
a technical discussion for another time).

Slide 5:
Nice summary!!

Slide 6:
Good stuff here, but I'll respond with some of my personal opinions:

- RevisionID: see points of concern already expressed above

- Specimen Record LSIDs: I gather from subsequent slides that you recognize
two alternative approaches: having the "owner" of a specimen assign the LSID
within the context of their own <domainName>, or adopting GBIF as the
international standard issuer for ALL specimen GUID. In other words, GBIF
would represent the centralized issuer of GUIDs for all biological
specimens, and the biological specimen community would/should rally around
GBIF for thus purpose, and adopt GBIF specimen GUIDs as their own.  I
personally have no problem with this (I do not live in fear of "Big Brother"
centralization when it serves the benefit of all, as I believe it would in
this case) -- but I know there are many who might have a problem with it,
and therefore it might not garner widespread adoption without large volumes
of "fuss".

If, on the other hand, each organization issues its own GUIDs for its own
set of specimens, then the question is when, if ever, GBIF would assign a
specimen GUID?  Perhaps as a surrogate for institutions that lack the
technological ability to assign their own LSIDs?  But I wonder, how many
institutions that could server electronic data of their holdings to the
internet would lack the ability to assign their own LSIDs?

As you've outlined in subsequent slides, I see two alternative paths:  A)
Get the biological world to rally around GBIF as the centralized provider of
GUIDs for specimens for all collections; or B) Have each
collection/institution issue its own set of LSIDs for its own specimens, and
have GBIF adopt those LSIDs for its own internal purposes.  I could get
behind either approach, but I see danger in the adoption of a mixture of
these two approaches. I'll defer elaboration, but a lot of it has to do with
potential confusion about whether the GUID applies fundamentally to the
physical specimen, or the electronic conglomeration of data associated with
the specimen. Also, I think we should avoid the risk of assigning two
separate GUIDs for the same "single data element" (sensu your Slide 5).

- Name record LSIDs:  I understand the example of an IPNI LSID for a plant
name, and presumably there would be analogous "Catalog of Fishes" LSIDs for
each fish name, etc.  But I don't think that would be a wise approach.
Unlike specimen records, where there are fairly unambiguous "owner"
institutions (or at least "original owner" institutions that issued a GUID),
taxonomic aggregators (IPNI, ITIS, Species2000, GBIF, uBio, etc.) are most
certainly not owners of the taxonomic names that they include in their
databases.  We would want to avoid the risk of duplicate GUIDs for the same
name, and thus the need for mapping, e.g., an IPNI GUID for a name to its
ITIS equivalent.  Again, I can't help but think that the world will be a
better place if we can avoid assigning multiple GUIDs to the same "single
data element".

One approach would be to rally around GBIF, and rely on them to issue GUIDs
for all taxon names.  However, I also recognize that we do not exist in a
political/personality vacuum with regards to "ownership" of taxonomic names,
or the electronic representations thereof.  Therefore, the closest thing
that exists to an "owner" of a taxonomic name is the Commission of
Nomenclature (and it's respective Code of Nomenclature) under which the name
was established.  Thus, when it comes to assigning GUIDs for names (not
concepts), I would propose the following:

urn:lsid:ICZN.org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all zoological names)
urn:lsid:ICBN.org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all botanical names)
urn:lsid:ICNB[or LBSN??].org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all bacteriological names)
urn:lsid:ICTV[or ICVCN??].org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all virus names)

In an ideal world, we'd get to the point where there would be a need for
only one registrar of nomenclature, e.g.:
urn:lsid:BioCode.org:TaxonName:XXXXXXX

Or, perhaps:
urn:lsid:gbif.net:TaxonName:XXXXXXX

But I don't think we're quite there yet.

In any case, the idea would be for the taxon name aggregators to adopt the
unambiguously unique GUID for each taxon name.

Taxonomic concepts are a whole 'nother ball of wax....

Slide 8:
I actually prefer this approach (GBIF as the central issuer of specimen
GUIDs), for a variety of reasons.  One of the main reasons is that it would
assure uniqueness of an integer within a given <namespace> (e.g.,
Specimens), which would make things a bit easier for those of us who like to
use integers as primary keys in databases.  In other words, it avoids the
possibility of urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567 colliding with
urn:lsid:usnm.gov:Specimen:1234567, when reducing the GUID to just its
integer component for local application purposes (where context can be
enforced by other means).  However, I should point something out regarding
the "Advantage" part of this slide, which is that the "problem" of
transferring record locations doesn't exist, provided that the <domainName>
component of the LSID is taken as the issuer of the GUID, not as the current
owner of the specimen.  In other words, if Bishop Museum assigned GUID
urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567 to a specimen, and then gave that
specimen to Smithsonian, then Smithsonian would retain the complete GUID
intact as: urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567.

The danger comes when you try to use the <domainName> component as metadata
to represent the current location of the specimen and/or its electronically
represented data.  This is where Wouter's original point about 'meaningless'
GUIDs comes into play. If the whole point of using LSIDs is to embed the
"current location" information within the ID itself so that applications can
retrieve additional data associated with the GUID directly, then I have some
concerns (mostly address already).

Why there is a reference to urn:lsid:gbif.net:TaxonConcept:106734 at the top
of this slide???

Slide 9:
Again, I'm not sure I understand on this slide why there is a reference to
urn:lsid:ipni.org:TaxonName:82090-3:1.1
Also, in this model, what function does the LSID serve that is not met by
the concatenated [InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] (in the
context of Global Provider Registry).

Slide 10 (taxon concepts and literature):
This message is already getting too long... :-)
I already touched on this above under "Slide 4".  I definitely agree that we
need a GUID system for References.  This should include more than just
published references. It doesn't quite exist yet among the existing
Reference registrars (as far as I can tell) to accommodate the specific
needs of taxonomists (e.g. referring to a subsection of a reference as
representing an original taxonomic description), so I do see a need to
create a Reference GUID system specific to biology.  I could rant for pages
on this, but I'll summarize simply with a plea to *DEFINE* a Concept GUID as
an intersection between an Name GUID and a Reference GUID (i.e., what I
would call an "Assertion").  Not all Name-Reference combinations will be
worthy of recognition as a distinct "Concept", but all are *potentially*
representative of a concept (Berendsohn), and thus all should be drawn from
the same pool of GUIDs as Concept GUIDs.  In other words, "Concepts" should
be thought of as a subtype of Name-Reference instances.  I would go further
to suggest (as I did above) that "Name" GUIDs should also be a subtype of
Name-Reference instances (non-exclusive of Concept subtype instances), using
the Name-Reference instance that represents the Code-recognized original
description of the name as the "handle" to the Name.

By this approach, you need only two GUID object classes <objectClass>: one
for References, and one for Name-Reference intersections (Assertions). The
latter of these could serve as the source for both Concept GUIDs and Name
GUIDs.

Last Slide:

My own answers to your questions:

1) Are LSIDs the most appropriate technology?

        I'm increasingly coming to that conclusion.

2) Should identifiers be assigned and resolved centrally or via a fully
distributed model (or should providers have the option of using either
model)?

        I think the best option would be central.  The next option would be full
distributed.  Leaving it as an option would, in my opinion, be a BIG
mistake.

3) Which objects should receive identifiers?

        Specimens, References, Name-Reference intersections (Assertions), and
perhaps Agents.  [TaxonNames and Concepts can be subsets of Name-Reference
intersections].

3a) Should we develop a set of object classes for biodiversity informatics
and assign identifiers to instances of all of these?

        I think so, yes. Of course, it depends a bit on who you mean by "we".  I'm
thinking sensu lato.

3b) Should identifiers be associated with real world objects (e.g.
specimens), or with digitised records representing them (e.g. perhaps
multiple records representing different digitisation attempts by different
researchers for the same specimen), or both?

        I would say definitely real-world objects (treating things like
Code-recognized original descriptions of taxon names, and citable references
as "real-world objects").  I do NOT think we should have separate GUIDs for
digital representations thereof.  Alternative digital representations are
simply clutter that will eventually be weeded out of the system, once we all
get organized on this stuff, and harness the power of the internet to
implement a global editing/QA system.

4) What should be done about existing records without identifiers?

        As far as I know, ALL records are currently without identifiers (unless
someone established a widely accepted GUID system and I missed the
announcement...)

4a) Should they be left alone?

        Ultimately, no.

4b) Should they all be updated with identifiers?

        Ultimately, yes.

4c) Should the provider software be modified to generate "soft" identifiers
(ones which we cannot guarantee in all cases to be unique) based e.g. on the
combination of InstitutionCode, CollectionCode and CatalogNumber?

        As an interim solution, perhaps.  See my comments under "Slide 2" above.

5) Are revision identifiers a useful feature?

        I would like to think not.  If the information is truly dynamic over time
(e.g., re-determinations of taxonomic identity of specimens), then
individual instances should probably receive their own set of GUIDs (as
opposed to versions of the "parent" GUID).  If the information is static
over time, and changes represent objective corrections, then I don't see a
real need to track that within the context of a GUID (record edit history
may or may not need to be tracked, but this seems to me to be a separate
issue from GUIDs).

5b) How many providers will be able to provide and handle them?

        If versioning is incorporated, then it should be designed such that a
"default" version is provided automatically when versioning is not handled.


Sorry for the long post, but I feel that this issue is extremely important
at this point in bioinformatics history.

Mahalo for your informative discussion, Rich.

A few questions.  You're pretty active on this so maybe you can help me out.

What about duplicate specimens?  Although a specimen may be MO 1234, K 5678
and P AABB, they may in fact all be SMITH 10001 and duplicates of the exact
same specimen, not different specimens. Is that one GUID or 3? When
attempting to use world-wide specimen records via GBIF for biodiversity
counts and species analyses, these duplicates artificially inflate the
counts significantly in some cases.

What about triplicate names?  IPNI is often given as the example for a set
of name records.  But, IPNI can have three records for the same exact name
and reference--one from IK, APNI and Grey Cards.  IPNI has no plans to ever
deduplicate these records due to the nature of the creation of the IPNI
collaboration.  So, do the three duplicate records get three GUIDs?

Where are the GUIDs actually to be perpetually located after they are
assigned?  Are all the originating organizations supposed to modify their
databases to add the GUID attribute and then build a mechanism to send out
their records and then receive the GUID back from somewhere and finally
update their records with it so the record+GUID can then in turn be
published from their database onto the web?

Couldn't agree more on the need for a single index/GUIDs to all references,
but beyond that is needed the single database containing all the GUIDS plus
the standard abbreviations and descriptions for them.  Nobody has this
database.  There are subsets like BPH and TL2.  But no single, definitive
list of all references, online, in one place with GUIDs.  This science needs
that in the worst way.

If a concept is Name+Reference, then don't IPNI and Tropicos contain
millions of concept records?

Subject: Re: Globally Unique Identifier


I want to start by wholeheartedly endorsing Wouter's plea for
non-information-bearing (meaningless) GUIDs.  This feature is CRITICAL to
the long-term success of any GUID system.  It is absolutely imperative that
there NEVER be any motivation to change the content of a GUID (i.e., it
should be permanent).  If the GUID itself contains any information
whatsoever, there may be motivation to change that information at a later
time.

For this reason, I had initially preferred the DOI approach, but over time,
I am gradually warming up to the LSID approach.  While components of an LSID
do, indeed, represent information, they represent the one piece of
information that I think may legitimately belong embedded within a GUID:
context.  That is, the context, or domain, of the GUID itself.  The context
in this case would be the "issuer" of the GUID -- not necessarily the
current "owner" of the GUID (see more discussion on this below).  Though the
organization that issued a GUID may eventually disappear, the fact that the
organization was the one to issue the GUID in the first place will never
change, and thus represents a permanent and unchanging component of the
GUID.  Without the context portion, the GUID itself is really nothing more
than a random string of characters.  In summary, I'm warming up to the LSID
approach because it represents embedded context, without the risk of
temptation to change the content of a GUID after it has been issued.

Regarding Donald's PPT file, I have a couple of comments and questions:
(Assumes Title slide is "Slide 1")

Slide 2:
You note there is "No reliable mechanism" to relate the same record from
different providers to each other.  But in the context of DarwinCore, the
combination of [InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] should
represent a virtual GUID (provided that the Global Provider Registry ensures
no duplication of [InstitutionCode]). I do realize that words like "should"
and "reliable" are critical here. Perhaps the DarwinCore implementation
should enforce the requirement of uniqueness of
[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] within a single [InstitutionCode], and
further ensure globally unique [InstitutionCode] values via the Global
Provider Registry.

Slide 3:
Wouldn't most of the problems indicated in the first four bulleted points be
largely solved by the Global Provider Registry? Using the [InstitutionCode]
would allow lookup in the registry for a (current/active) metadata URL, and
the metadata URL would provide information on where to access a particular
[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] piece of data.

The issue of specimens changing numbers and/or collections is problematic,
of course.

The issue of versioning is a bit dicey, in my mind (e.g., at what resolution
of information change)?  Some things, like changing taxonomic determinations
(i.e., "real" changes) need to be handled in a robust way.  Other things,
like the correction of typos and different styles of representing the exact
same information (e.g., R.L. Pile==>R.L. Pyle; or R.L. Pyle==>Pyle, R.L.)
probably don't need to be versioned.  Other sorts of changes (e.g., the
elaboration of previously existing information, such as the addition of
retroactively-generated georeference coordinates) fall somewhere in-between.

Slide 4:
We should all get behind SEEK in addressing these issues (Taxon concept
mapping). Ultimately, we minimally need a GUID pool for References
(inclusive of unpublished works), and a GUID pool for what I call
"Protonyms" (original creations of IC_N Code-compliant names).  The union of
these two GUIDs (what I would call "Assertions") would itself represent a
GUID to a "potential concept" (Berendsohn). (Note: my preference would be to
define Protonyms as a subtype of Assertions, and therefore Protonym GUIDs
would be a subset drawn from the same pool as Assertion GUIDs -- but this is
a technical discussion for another time).

Slide 5:
Nice summary!!

Slide 6:
Good stuff here, but I'll respond with some of my personal opinions:

- RevisionID: see points of concern already expressed above

- Specimen Record LSIDs: I gather from subsequent slides that you recognize
two alternative approaches: having the "owner" of a specimen assign the LSID
within the context of their own <domainName>, or adopting GBIF as the
international standard issuer for ALL specimen GUID. In other words, GBIF
would represent the centralized issuer of GUIDs for all biological
specimens, and the biological specimen community would/should rally around
GBIF for thus purpose, and adopt GBIF specimen GUIDs as their own.  I
personally have no problem with this (I do not live in fear of "Big Brother"
centralization when it serves the benefit of all, as I believe it would in
this case) -- but I know there are many who might have a problem with it,
and therefore it might not garner widespread adoption without large volumes
of "fuss".

If, on the other hand, each organization issues its own GUIDs for its own
set of specimens, then the question is when, if ever, GBIF would assign a
specimen GUID?  Perhaps as a surrogate for institutions that lack the
technological ability to assign their own LSIDs?  But I wonder, how many
institutions that could server electronic data of their holdings to the
internet would lack the ability to assign their own LSIDs?

As you've outlined in subsequent slides, I see two alternative paths:  A)
Get the biological world to rally around GBIF as the centralized provider of
GUIDs for specimens for all collections; or B) Have each
collection/institution issue its own set of LSIDs for its own specimens, and
have GBIF adopt those LSIDs for its own internal purposes.  I could get
behind either approach, but I see danger in the adoption of a mixture of
these two approaches. I'll defer elaboration, but a lot of it has to do with
potential confusion about whether the GUID applies fundamentally to the
physical specimen, or the electronic conglomeration of data associated with
the specimen. Also, I think we should avoid the risk of assigning two
separate GUIDs for the same "single data element" (sensu your Slide 5).

- Name record LSIDs:  I understand the example of an IPNI LSID for a plant
name, and presumably there would be analogous "Catalog of Fishes" LSIDs for
each fish name, etc.  But I don't think that would be a wise approach.
Unlike specimen records, where there are fairly unambiguous "owner"
institutions (or at least "original owner" institutions that issued a GUID),
taxonomic aggregators (IPNI, ITIS, Species2000, GBIF, uBio, etc.) are most
certainly not owners of the taxonomic names that they include in their
databases.  We would want to avoid the risk of duplicate GUIDs for the same
name, and thus the need for mapping, e.g., an IPNI GUID for a name to its
ITIS equivalent.  Again, I can't help but think that the world will be a
better place if we can avoid assigning multiple GUIDs to the same "single
data element".

One approach would be to rally around GBIF, and rely on them to issue GUIDs
for all taxon names.  However, I also recognize that we do not exist in a
political/personality vacuum with regards to "ownership" of taxonomic names,
or the electronic representations thereof.  Therefore, the closest thing
that exists to an "owner" of a taxonomic name is the Commission of
Nomenclature (and it's respective Code of Nomenclature) under which the name
was established.  Thus, when it comes to assigning GUIDs for names (not
concepts), I would propose the following:

urn:lsid:ICZN.org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all zoological names)
urn:lsid:ICBN.org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all botanical names) urn:lsid:ICNB[or
LBSN??].org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all bacteriological names) urn:lsid:ICTV[or
ICVCN??].org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all virus names)

In an ideal world, we'd get to the point where there would be a need for
only one registrar of nomenclature, e.g.:
urn:lsid:BioCode.org:TaxonName:XXXXXXX

Or, perhaps:
urn:lsid:gbif.net:TaxonName:XXXXXXX

But I don't think we're quite there yet.

In any case, the idea would be for the taxon name aggregators to adopt the
unambiguously unique GUID for each taxon name.

Taxonomic concepts are a whole 'nother ball of wax....

Slide 8:
I actually prefer this approach (GBIF as the central issuer of specimen
GUIDs), for a variety of reasons.  One of the main reasons is that it would
assure uniqueness of an integer within a given <namespace> (e.g.,
Specimens), which would make things a bit easier for those of us who like to
use integers as primary keys in databases.  In other words, it avoids the
possibility of urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567 colliding with
urn:lsid:usnm.gov:Specimen:1234567, when reducing the GUID to just its
integer component for local application purposes (where context can be
enforced by other means).  However, I should point something out regarding
the "Advantage" part of this slide, which is that the "problem" of
transferring record locations doesn't exist, provided that the <domainName>
component of the LSID is taken as the issuer of the GUID, not as the current
owner of the specimen.  In other words, if Bishop Museum assigned GUID
urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567 to a specimen, and then gave that
specimen to Smithsonian, then Smithsonian would retain the complete GUID
intact as: urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567.

The danger comes when you try to use the <domainName> component as metadata
to represent the current location of the specimen and/or its electronically
represented data.  This is where Wouter's original point about 'meaningless'
GUIDs comes into play. If the whole point of using LSIDs is to embed the
"current location" information within the ID itself so that applications can
retrieve additional data associated with the GUID directly, then I have some
concerns (mostly address already).

Why there is a reference to urn:lsid:gbif.net:TaxonConcept:106734 at the top
of this slide???

Slide 9:
Again, I'm not sure I understand on this slide why there is a reference to
urn:lsid:ipni.org:TaxonName:82090-3:1.1
Also, in this model, what function does the LSID serve that is not met by
the concatenated [InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] (in the
context of Global Provider Registry).

Slide 10 (taxon concepts and literature):
This message is already getting too long... :-)
I already touched on this above under "Slide 4".  I definitely agree that we
need a GUID system for References.  This should include more than just
published references. It doesn't quite exist yet among the existing
Reference registrars (as far as I can tell) to accommodate the specific
needs of taxonomists (e.g. referring to a subsection of a reference as
representing an original taxonomic description), so I do see a need to
create a Reference GUID system specific to biology.  I could rant for pages
on this, but I'll summarize simply with a plea to *DEFINE* a Concept GUID as
an intersection between an Name GUID and a Reference GUID (i.e., what I
would call an "Assertion").  Not all Name-Reference combinations will be
worthy of recognition as a distinct "Concept", but all are *potentially*
representative of a concept (Berendsohn), and thus all should be drawn from
the same pool of GUIDs as Concept GUIDs.  In other words, "Concepts" should
be thought of as a subtype of Name-Reference instances.  I would go further
to suggest (as I did above) that "Name" GUIDs should also be a subtype of
Name-Reference instances (non-exclusive of Concept subtype instances), using
the Name-Reference instance that represents the Code-recognized original
description of the name as the "handle" to the Name.

By this approach, you need only two GUID object classes <objectClass>: one
for References, and one for Name-Reference intersections (Assertions). The
latter of these could serve as the source for both Concept GUIDs and Name
GUIDs.

Last Slide:

My own answers to your questions:

1) Are LSIDs the most appropriate technology?

        I'm increasingly coming to that conclusion.

2) Should identifiers be assigned and resolved centrally or via a fully
distributed model (or should providers have the option of using either
model)?

        I think the best option would be central.  The next option would be
full distributed.  Leaving it as an option would, in my opinion, be a BIG
mistake.

3) Which objects should receive identifiers?

        Specimens, References, Name-Reference intersections (Assertions),
and perhaps Agents.  [TaxonNames and Concepts can be subsets of
Name-Reference intersections].

3a) Should we develop a set of object classes for biodiversity informatics
and assign identifiers to instances of all of these?

        I think so, yes. Of course, it depends a bit on who you mean by
"we".  I'm thinking sensu lato.

3b) Should identifiers be associated with real world objects (e.g.
specimens), or with digitised records representing them (e.g. perhaps
multiple records representing different digitisation attempts by different
researchers for the same specimen), or both?

        I would say definitely real-world objects (treating things like
Code-recognized original descriptions of taxon names, and citable references
as "real-world objects").  I do NOT think we should have separate GUIDs for
digital representations thereof.  Alternative digital representations are
simply clutter that will eventually be weeded out of the system, once we all
get organized on this stuff, and harness the power of the internet to
implement a global editing/QA system.

4) What should be done about existing records without identifiers?

        As far as I know, ALL records are currently without identifiers
(unless someone established a widely accepted GUID system and I missed the
announcement...)

4a) Should they be left alone?

        Ultimately, no.

4b) Should they all be updated with identifiers?

        Ultimately, yes.

4c) Should the provider software be modified to generate "soft" identifiers
(ones which we cannot guarantee in all cases to be unique) based e.g. on the
combination of InstitutionCode, CollectionCode and CatalogNumber?

        As an interim solution, perhaps.  See my comments under "Slide 2"
above.

5) Are revision identifiers a useful feature?

        I would like to think not.  If the information is truly dynamic over
time (e.g., re-determinations of taxonomic identity of specimens), then
individual instances should probably receive their own set of GUIDs (as
opposed to versions of the "parent" GUID).  If the information is static
over time, and changes represent objective corrections, then I don't see a
real need to track that within the context of a GUID (record edit history
may or may not need to be tracked, but this seems to me to be a separate
issue from GUIDs).

5b) How many providers will be able to provide and handle them?

        If versioning is incorporated, then it should be designed such that
a "default" version is provided automatically when versioning is not
handled.


Sorry for the long post, but I feel that this issue is extremely important
at this point in bioinformatics history.

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Mahalo for your informative discussion, Rich.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>A few questions.&nbsp; You're pretty active on this =
so maybe you can help me out.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>What about duplicate specimens?&nbsp; Although a =
specimen may be MO 1234, K 5678 and P AABB, they may in fact all be =
SMITH 10001 and duplicates of the exact same specimen, not different =
specimens. Is that one GUID or 3? When attempting to use world-wide =
specimen records via GBIF for biodiversity counts and species analyses, =
these duplicates artificially inflate the counts significantly in some =
cases.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>What about triplicate names?&nbsp; IPNI is often =
given as the example for a set of name records.&nbsp; But, IPNI can =
have three records for the same exact name and reference--one from IK, =
APNI and Grey Cards.&nbsp; IPNI has no plans to ever deduplicate these =
records due to the nature of the creation of the IPNI =
collaboration.&nbsp; So, do the three duplicate records get three =
GUIDs?&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Where are the GUIDs actually to be perpetually =
located after they are assigned?&nbsp; Are all the originating =
organizations supposed to modify their databases to add the GUID =
attribute and then build a mechanism to send out their records and then =
receive the GUID back from somewhere and finally update their records =
with it so the record+GUID can then in turn be published from their =
database onto the web?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Couldn't agree more on the need for a single =
index/GUIDs to all references, but beyond that is needed the single =
database containing all the GUIDS plus the standard abbreviations and =
descriptions for them.&nbsp; Nobody has this database.&nbsp; There are =
subsets like BPH and TL2.&nbsp; But no single, definitive list of all =
references, online, in one place with GUIDs.&nbsp; This science needs =
that in the worst way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>If a concept is Name+Reference, then don't IPNI and =
Tropicos contain millions of concept records?</FONT>
</P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>From: Richard Pyle [<A =
HREF=3D"mailto:deepreef@BISHOPMUSEUM.ORG">mailto:deepreef@BISHOPMUSEUM.O=

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Sent: Thursday, September 23, 2004 6:29 PM</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Subject: Re: Globally Unique Identifier</FONT>
</P>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I want to start by wholeheartedly endorsing Wouter's =
plea for non-information-bearing (meaningless) GUIDs.&nbsp; This =
feature is CRITICAL to the long-term success of any GUID system.&nbsp; =
It is absolutely imperative that there NEVER be any motivation to =
change the content of a GUID (i.e., it should be permanent).&nbsp; If =
the GUID itself contains any information whatsoever, there may be =
motivation to change that information at a later time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>For this reason, I had initially preferred the DOI =
approach, but over time, I am gradually warming up to the LSID =
approach.&nbsp; While components of an LSID do, indeed, represent =
information, they represent the one piece of information that I think =
may legitimately belong embedded within a GUID: context.&nbsp; That is, =
the context, or domain, of the GUID itself.&nbsp; The context in this =
case would be the &quot;issuer&quot; of the GUID -- not necessarily the =
current &quot;owner&quot; of the GUID (see more discussion on this =
below).&nbsp; Though the organization that issued a GUID may eventually =
disappear, the fact that the organization was the one to issue the GUID =
in the first place will never change, and thus represents a permanent =
and unchanging component of the GUID.&nbsp; Without the context =
portion, the GUID itself is really nothing more than a random string of =
characters.&nbsp; In summary, I'm warming up to the LSID approach =
because it represents embedded context, without the risk of temptation =
to change the content of a GUID after it has been issued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Regarding Donald's PPT file, I have a couple of =
comments and questions: (Assumes Title slide is &quot;Slide =
1&quot;)</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 2:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>You note there is &quot;No reliable mechanism&quot; =
to relate the same record from different providers to each other.&nbsp; =
But in the context of DarwinCore, the combination of =
[InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] should represent a =
virtual GUID (provided that the Global Provider Registry ensures no =
duplication of [InstitutionCode]). I do realize that words like =
&quot;should&quot; and &quot;reliable&quot; are critical here. Perhaps =
the DarwinCore implementation should enforce the requirement of =
uniqueness of [CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] within a single =
[InstitutionCode], and further ensure globally unique [InstitutionCode] =
values via the Global Provider Registry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 3:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Wouldn't most of the problems indicated in the first =
four bulleted points be largely solved by the Global Provider Registry? =
Using the [InstitutionCode] would allow lookup in the registry for a =
(current/active) metadata URL, and the metadata URL would provide =
information on where to access a particular =
[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] piece of data.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The issue of specimens changing numbers and/or =
collections is problematic, of course.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The issue of versioning is a bit dicey, in my mind =
(e.g., at what resolution of information change)?&nbsp; Some things, =
like changing taxonomic determinations (i.e., &quot;real&quot; changes) =
need to be handled in a robust way.&nbsp; Other things, like the =
correction of typos and different styles of representing the exact same =
information (e.g., R.L. Pile=3D=3D&gt;R.L. Pyle; or R.L. =
Pyle=3D=3D&gt;Pyle, R.L.) probably don't need to be versioned.&nbsp; =
Other sorts of changes (e.g., the elaboration of previously existing =
information, such as the addition of retroactively-generated =
georeference coordinates) fall somewhere in-between.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 4:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>We should all get behind SEEK in addressing these =
issues (Taxon concept mapping). Ultimately, we minimally need a GUID =
pool for References (inclusive of unpublished works), and a GUID pool =
for what I call &quot;Protonyms&quot; (original creations of IC_N =
Code-compliant names).&nbsp; The union of these two GUIDs (what I would =
call &quot;Assertions&quot;) would itself represent a GUID to a =
&quot;potential concept&quot; (Berendsohn). (Note: my preference would =
be to define Protonyms as a subtype of Assertions, and therefore =
Protonym GUIDs would be a subset drawn from the same pool as Assertion =
GUIDs -- but this is a technical discussion for another =
time).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 5:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Nice summary!!</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 6:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Good stuff here, but I'll respond with some of my =
personal opinions:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- RevisionID: see points of concern already expressed =
above</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- Specimen Record LSIDs: I gather from subsequent =
slides that you recognize two alternative approaches: having the =
&quot;owner&quot; of a specimen assign the LSID within the context of =
their own &lt;domainName&gt;, or adopting GBIF as the international =
standard issuer for ALL specimen GUID. In other words, GBIF would =
represent the centralized issuer of GUIDs for all biological specimens, =
and the biological specimen community would/should rally around GBIF =
for thus purpose, and adopt GBIF specimen GUIDs as their own.&nbsp; I =
personally have no problem with this (I do not live in fear of =
&quot;Big Brother&quot; centralization when it serves the benefit of =
all, as I believe it would in this case) -- but I know there are many =
who might have a problem with it, and therefore it might not garner =
widespread adoption without large volumes of =
&quot;fuss&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>If, on the other hand, each organization issues its =
own GUIDs for its own set of specimens, then the question is when, if =
ever, GBIF would assign a specimen GUID?&nbsp; Perhaps as a surrogate =
for institutions that lack the technological ability to assign their =
own LSIDs?&nbsp; But I wonder, how many institutions that could server =
electronic data of their holdings to the internet would lack the =
ability to assign their own LSIDs?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>As you've outlined in subsequent slides, I see two =
alternative paths:&nbsp; A) Get the biological world to rally around =
GBIF as the centralized provider of GUIDs for specimens for all =
collections; or B) Have each collection/institution issue its own set =
of LSIDs for its own specimens, and have GBIF adopt those LSIDs for its =
own internal purposes.&nbsp; I could get behind either approach, but I =
see danger in the adoption of a mixture of these two approaches. I'll =
defer elaboration, but a lot of it has to do with potential confusion =
about whether the GUID applies fundamentally to the physical specimen, =
or the electronic conglomeration of data associated with the specimen. =
Also, I think we should avoid the risk of assigning two separate GUIDs =
for the same &quot;single data element&quot; (sensu your Slide =
5).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>- Name record LSIDs:&nbsp; I understand the example =
of an IPNI LSID for a plant name, and presumably there would be =
analogous &quot;Catalog of Fishes&quot; LSIDs for each fish name, =
etc.&nbsp; But I don't think that would be a wise approach. Unlike =
specimen records, where there are fairly unambiguous &quot;owner&quot; =
institutions (or at least &quot;original owner&quot; institutions that =
issued a GUID), taxonomic aggregators (IPNI, ITIS, Species2000, GBIF, =
uBio, etc.) are most certainly not owners of the taxonomic names that =
they include in their databases.&nbsp; We would want to avoid the risk =
of duplicate GUIDs for the same name, and thus the need for mapping, =
e.g., an IPNI GUID for a name to its ITIS equivalent.&nbsp; Again, I =
can't help but think that the world will be a better place if we can =
avoid assigning multiple GUIDs to the same &quot;single data =
element&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>One approach would be to rally around GBIF, and rely =
on them to issue GUIDs for all taxon names.&nbsp; However, I also =
recognize that we do not exist in a political/personality vacuum with =
regards to &quot;ownership&quot; of taxonomic names, or the electronic =
representations thereof.&nbsp; Therefore, the closest thing that exists =
to an &quot;owner&quot; of a taxonomic name is the Commission of =
Nomenclature (and it's respective Code of Nomenclature) under which the =
name was established.&nbsp; Thus, when it comes to assigning GUIDs for =
names (not concepts), I would propose the following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>urn:lsid:ICZN.org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all zoological =
names) urn:lsid:ICBN.org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all botanical names) =
urn:lsid:ICNB[or LBSN??].org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all bacteriological =
names) urn:lsid:ICTV[or ICVCN??].org:TaxonName:XXXXXX (all virus =
names)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In an ideal world, we'd get to the point where there =
would be a need for only one registrar of nomenclature, e.g.: =
urn:lsid:BioCode.org:TaxonName:XXXXXXX</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Or, perhaps:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>urn:lsid:gbif.net:TaxonName:XXXXXXX</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>But I don't think we're quite there yet.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In any case, the idea would be for the taxon name =
aggregators to adopt the unambiguously unique GUID for each taxon =
name.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Taxonomic concepts are a whole 'nother ball of =
wax....</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 8:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>I actually prefer this approach (GBIF as the central =
issuer of specimen GUIDs), for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; One of the =
main reasons is that it would assure uniqueness of an integer within a =
given &lt;namespace&gt; (e.g., Specimens), which would make things a =
bit easier for those of us who like to use integers as primary keys in =
databases.&nbsp; In other words, it avoids the possibility of =
urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567 colliding with =
urn:lsid:usnm.gov:Specimen:1234567, when reducing the GUID to just its =
integer component for local application purposes (where context can be =
enforced by other means).&nbsp; However, I should point something out =
regarding the &quot;Advantage&quot; part of this slide, which is that =
the &quot;problem&quot; of transferring record locations doesn't exist, =
provided that the &lt;domainName&gt; component of the LSID is taken as =
the issuer of the GUID, not as the current owner of the specimen.&nbsp; =
In other words, if Bishop Museum assigned GUID =
urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567 to a specimen, and then gave =
that specimen to Smithsonian, then Smithsonian would retain the =
complete GUID intact as: =
urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The danger comes when you try to use the =
&lt;domainName&gt; component as metadata to represent the current =
location of the specimen and/or its electronically represented =
data.&nbsp; This is where Wouter's original point about 'meaningless' =
GUIDs comes into play. If the whole point of using LSIDs is to embed =
the &quot;current location&quot; information within the ID itself so =
that applications can retrieve additional data associated with the GUID =
directly, then I have some concerns (mostly address =
already).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Why there is a reference to =
urn:lsid:gbif.net:TaxonConcept:106734 at the top of this =
slide???</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 9:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Again, I'm not sure I understand on this slide why =
there is a reference to urn:lsid:ipni.org:TaxonName:82090-3:1.1</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Also, in this model, what function does the LSID =
serve that is not met by the concatenated =
[InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] (in the context of =
Global Provider Registry).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Slide 10 (taxon concepts and literature):</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>This message is already getting too long... =
:-)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>I already touched on this above under &quot;Slide =
4&quot;.&nbsp; I definitely agree that we need a GUID system for =
References.&nbsp; This should include more than just published =
references. It doesn't quite exist yet among the existing Reference =
registrars (as far as I can tell) to accommodate the specific needs of =
taxonomists (e.g. referring to a subsection of a reference as =
representing an original taxonomic description), so I do see a need to =
create a Reference GUID system specific to biology.&nbsp; I could rant =
for pages on this, but I'll summarize simply with a plea to *DEFINE* a =
Concept GUID as an intersection between an Name GUID and a Reference =
GUID (i.e., what I would call an &quot;Assertion&quot;).&nbsp; Not all =
Name-Reference combinations will be worthy of recognition as a distinct =
&quot;Concept&quot;, but all are *potentially* representative of a =
concept (Berendsohn), and thus all should be drawn from the same pool =
of GUIDs as Concept GUIDs.&nbsp; In other words, &quot;Concepts&quot; =
should be thought of as a subtype of Name-Reference instances.&nbsp; I =
would go further to suggest (as I did above) that &quot;Name&quot; =
GUIDs should also be a subtype of Name-Reference instances =
(non-exclusive of Concept subtype instances), using the Name-Reference =
instance that represents the Code-recognized original description of =
the name as the &quot;handle&quot; to the Name.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>By this approach, you need only two GUID object =
classes &lt;objectClass&gt;: one for References, and one for =
Name-Reference intersections (Assertions). The latter of these could =
serve as the source for both Concept GUIDs and Name GUIDs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Last Slide:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>My own answers to your questions:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>1) Are LSIDs the most appropriate technology?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm =
increasingly coming to that conclusion.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>2) Should identifiers be assigned and resolved =
centrally or via a fully distributed model (or should providers have =
the option of using either model)?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think =
the best option would be central.&nbsp; The next option would be full =
distributed.&nbsp; Leaving it as an option would, in my opinion, be a =
BIG mistake.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>3) Which objects should receive identifiers?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specimens, =
References, Name-Reference intersections (Assertions), and perhaps =
Agents.&nbsp; [TaxonNames and Concepts can be subsets of Name-Reference =
intersections].</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>3a) Should we develop a set of object classes for =
biodiversity informatics and assign identifiers to instances of all of =
these?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think =
so, yes. Of course, it depends a bit on who you mean by =
&quot;we&quot;.&nbsp; I'm thinking sensu lato.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>3b) Should identifiers be associated with real world =
objects (e.g. specimens), or with digitised records representing them =
(e.g. perhaps multiple records representing different digitisation =
attempts by different researchers for the same specimen), or =
both?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would =
say definitely real-world objects (treating things like Code-recognized =
original descriptions of taxon names, and citable references as =
&quot;real-world objects&quot;).&nbsp; I do NOT think we should have =
separate GUIDs for digital representations thereof.&nbsp; Alternative =
digital representations are simply clutter that will eventually be =
weeded out of the system, once we all get organized on this stuff, and =
harness the power of the internet to implement a global editing/QA =
system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>4) What should be done about existing records without =
identifiers?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as =
I know, ALL records are currently without identifiers (unless someone =
established a widely accepted GUID system and I missed the</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>announcement...)</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>4a) Should they be left alone?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
Ultimately, no.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>4b) Should they all be updated with =
identifiers?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
Ultimately, yes.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>4c) Should the provider software be modified to =
generate &quot;soft&quot; identifiers (ones which we cannot guarantee =
in all cases to be unique) based e.g. on the combination of =
InstitutionCode, CollectionCode and CatalogNumber?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an =
interim solution, perhaps.&nbsp; See my comments under &quot;Slide =
2&quot; above.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>5) Are revision identifiers a useful feature?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would =
like to think not.&nbsp; If the information is truly dynamic over time =
(e.g., re-determinations of taxonomic identity of specimens), then =
individual instances should probably receive their own set of GUIDs (as =
opposed to versions of the &quot;parent&quot; GUID).&nbsp; If the =
information is static over time, and changes represent objective =
corrections, then I don't see a real need to track that within the =
context of a GUID (record edit history may or may not need to be =

In my view, we would assign only ONE GUID, which represents the actual,
physical specimen.  That this one specimen has multiple catalog number
assigned to it is simply additional information associated with that one
specimen (in the same way that many specimens may have more than one
taxonomic name applied to it, by different investigators at different
times).  This is part of the problem with using the "soft" GUID surrogate of
[InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber].  A simple solution would
be to select one of these catalog numbers (e.g., SMITH 10001) as the
"current" catalog number, and enter that in the appropriate DarwinCore (DwC)
fields (either [CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber] or
[InstitutionCode]+[CatalogNumber], in this case). The MaNIS implementation
of DwC included a "OtherCatalogNumbers" element, which would store the other
numbers.

I imagine two main problems:

1) Data for the single specimen may be represented more than once in an
Aggregator, if different providers represent the "soft" GUID for the
specimen with two different catalog numbers.  For human-viewed search
results, it would probably be evident soon by looking at the other data that
the two records are the same.  For statistical search results, the specimen
would be counted more than once, which could cause errors in the numeric
results of statistical queries.

2) If the record is only represented by one of its catalog numbers, then how
is someone supposed to locate it by one of the other catalog numbers?  One
way is to include support for a "OtherCatalogNumbers" element, in such a way
that it can be searched in addition to the "soft" GUID of
[InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber]. But that's a bit
convoluted.

So, the real solution, in my mind, is to implement a "hard" GUID
("GlobalUniqueIdentifier":
http://darwincore.calacademy.org/Documentation/DarwinCore2DraftHTML).  That
way, the specimen could be represented in four different Provider records,
but easily combine as one by an Aggregator via the shared GUID.

Yes -- that's what I meant by "statistical search results".  Presumably,
DiGIR Providers should only provide data on specimens that they current
hold.  For instance, if BPBM 12345 was donated to Smithsonian, and now has
the new catalog number USNM 987654, then Bishop Museum should not include
the record in its DiGIR provider under its original catalog number (BPBM
12345).  Bishop could either represent it with the current catalog number
(USNM 987654), in which case an Aggregator could easily identify it as the
same specimen, or Bishop should exclude it from its DiGIR provider
altogether.

Of course, none of this is perfect -- there are likely to be all kinds of
errors of this sort when institutions wholesale dump their electronic
catalogs online in the form of DiGIR providers.  But the same is true of
"hard" GUIDs.  What's to stop Bishop Museum from assigning one GUID to its
record of BPBM 12345, and Smithsonian assigning another GUID to its record
of USNM 987654?  The correct answer is, "nothing, really" -- except to
whatever extent the people in charge of assigning these GUIDs to specimens
in their charge are careful to avoid making such duplications.  But nobody
is perfect -- which is why *any* GUID system is going to require some sort
of integrated "inadvertent duplication index", to keep a permanent index of
"objective" duplications (not to be confused with "subjective" record
equivalencies, such as this taxonomic concept is equivalent to that
taxonomic concept).

Not intentionally -- no (at least not in my view).  But I can very easily
see how they would inadvertently be assigned different GUIDs -- hence the
need to be able to seamlessly deal with objective duplicates when they are
discovered.

> Where are the GUIDs actually to be perpetually located after they are

That's the crux of the question posed in Donald's PowerPoint file.  My
inclination is to pick a more centralized organization that seems likely to
survive in the long run (GBIF seems to me to be a leading candidate;
although for taxonomic names, I would still favor the respective
nomenclatural Commissions).

I would like to think so, yes.  Certainly all organizations that set up a
DiGIR provider.  If you follow the link (above) to the DwC2 draft, you'll
see that the first element is "GlobalUniqueIdentifier", which is required in
the current draft.  A stop-gap solution is to concatenate a "soft" GUID in
the form of:

URN:catalog:[InstitutionCode]:[CollectionCode]:[CatalogNumber]

...but personally, I see this only as a temporary solution. I'd rather see
the bioinformatics community bite the bullet and commit to a "hard" GUID
system.

I agree on all counts.  Which is why I think someone (GBIF?) needs to build
it.  It won't suddenly materialize out of nothing -- it will have to be
built over time.  If you want to assign a GUID to a Taxon Name, you must
first enter the citation details for its original description Reference in
the Reference GUID issuer.

It depends on what you mean by "Concept".  Note in my last email that I
explicitly identified "Concepts" as a *subset* of Name+Reference instances.
Who decides which Name+Reference instances are "concept-bearers" and which
are not? Tough question -- but one that is being thought about by the SEEK
folks. Similarly, who decides which Name+Reference instances are
"Name-bearers"?  That's easier to answer:  the respective Code of
Nomenclature.

Will there be millions of concept records? Well, given that there are
millions of names, I imagine there will probably be tens of millions of
Concepts to which those names have been, or will be, applied.  There will,
of course, be BILLIONS of Name+Reference instances.  I say this with
confidence because, in my view, every identification label of every specimen
in the world could potentially be considered as a "Reference", and there are
presumably billions of specimens out there.  But I'm not terribly concerned
about such large numbers.  As of this moment, there are 4,285,199,774 web
pages indexed by Google, yet it can find what I'm looking for with AMAZING
speed and efficiency -- and that's without any semantic context.  What we're
talking about here is highly structured data in a tightly controlled
semantic context.  Computers are exceedingly good and managing vast
quantities of data very quickly -- and they're getting better and faster all
the time.  By the time we (the Bioinformatics community) get around to
digitizing billions of specimens and Name+Reference instances, the hard
drive on my laptop will be measured in Terabytes.

I have to disagree - kind of.  A non-information-bearing GUID such as
one generated by a MAC, eg

{92AB5B37-70E9-4f05-9E97-CBABD08513ED}

is completely useless unless it only appears within the context of a
system that provides more information about what it actually is.  That's
the point of the LSID or DOI, they provide GUIDs that identify what
system can be used to resolve them.  If GUIDs for names or specimens or
whatever are to be used in other systems, then it is essential that the
GUID can be associated with a resolving system.

Both the DOI and LSID approaches are structured and provide context.
The DOI system uses the NISO Z39.84-2000 standard for categorization,
the LSID uses the domain name system.  Both provide a context essential
for reuse of an identifier outside it's original context.

This was one of the first recommendations to GBIF - to provide a
registry of institution codes for exactly this purpose.  Having a tool
that verified the uniqueness of records within a collection as exposed
by it's provider (either biocase or digir) would help this uniqueness
problem.  Now that the UDDI registry is available, we could in theory
use the institution identifiers in there.

Good progress is being made on this, prototypes should be ready for

I strongly disagree that there should be a single GUID issuer or
resolver.  What we really need is an organization that operates kind of
like a certificate authority- GBIF could act as the root from which
other trusted GUID issuers may be created.  In this way we can avoid the
arbitrary creation of GUIDs yet still provide considerable flexibility
and de-centralization in the community.

It would be a relatively simple task to include a LSID resolver service
along with a DiGIR provider.  I have prototyped such a system a while
back, but other issues prevented deployment.  With such an
implementation, it would be trivial to assign unique identifiers to
specimens - but first the problems institutions seem to have even
providing unique identifiers within a collection must be resolved.

A mixture would still work, provided there was appropriate coordination

It is quite likely that there will be multiple LSID generators and
issuers.  There is no real reason why this should be prevented, except
to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to avoid duplication of
GUIDs for the same object (taxonomic concept in this case).  So a
critical piece of infrastructure for a name service that was intending
to assign GUIDs would be a mechanism for determining if the object they
are about to assign the GUID to is not already present in the system,
held at some other location.  There needs to be something like a global
"findThisObject(taxon_object)" that absolutely guarantees that the
instance doesn't exist some other place.  And if duplicates were to
occur, then there must also be a mechanism for indicating equivalence
between GUIDs, or perhaps a way of deleting the duplicate (how to decide
which is the duplicate?).

Forcing the use of a single DN such as BioCode.org for all names would
seem to be a mistake, since that implies a single resolver service for
all names- with obvious implications in case of failure.  Perhaps there
can be multiple resolver services with a single DN?  That would probably
work fine then.

The LSID service must be able to resolve the object.  When the object
moves some other place, then there will need to be a mechanism for the
LSID service to forward the resolution to the appropriate service.  The
really big problem is when an institution no longer exists - so the
hypothetical example of Bishop museum consuming all the Smithsonian fish
collections - the Smithsonian LSID resolver would perhaps no longer
exist, and so those LSIDs become meaningless.  Perhaps there's a
delegation mechanism that can be used?  So when a DN can't be resolved,
the system backs down to a default DN, such as gbif.org that would then
indicate that smithsonian.org is now bishop.org?

I agree.  The LSID system is easy to implement, stable, scalable and
does everything we need.  The DOI system is good as well, but the fee
scheme bothers me (though I understand there are ways around that).

I disagree- the assignment of identifiers should be by the curators of
the data.  However, I do strongly consider that there should be some
sort of trust scheme in place, where identifiers are issued only by
entities trusted by the rest of the system.  A scheme similar to that
used by certificate authorities and delegates should be adequate.

Any object.  It doesn't matter what it is, just that it can be resolved,
and when you find it, you can figure out what it is.  Sensible use of
the NameSpace portion of the LSID will help a lot with this.  A trusted
organization should issue the NameSpace portion to avoid NS conflicts.

Sure, and these could be a core from which others can be built.  But we
should asolutely not restrict the capability of the "system" to accept
new classes - even classes that represent the same infomration in a
different way that may be appropriate to a group of users.

Yeah, we need to be very clear about what these identifiers are assigned
to.  There should be very clear documentation about this that is
accepted by the relevant community.  Where possible, it makes a lot of
sense to use the same identifier in the electronic record as that
associated withthe physical object- afterall, the electronic data is
really just metadata about the physical object.

All records currently have some sort of identifier, the problem is their
uniqueness is not rigorously enforced or even evaluated, so their
usefulness is probably limited.

All records that will be referenced by another entity need to have
unique identifiers in order for a robust system that allows reuse of
data to be properly implemented.

Yes, but not soft.  The providers should assign their own identifiers,
but there must be a mechanism to ensure that identifiers are being
properly assigned.

Revision information is very helpful in dealing with errors such as
keystroke errors or other such details that do not change the object.

Not many.  It seems most collections don't record any history in their
record edits, so without a major alteration in the way the data are
stored, it will be a significant undertaking to provide useful revision
information.

Yes, that would be an assumption.  But not an unreasonable one.  I'm trying
to imagine a scenario where I am presented with a series of MAC id's where I
don't inherently understand the context.  I suppose if I came in to work and
found such a number scribbled on a piece of paper, with no other
information, I'd be in a fix to figure out what the number refers to.  But
obviously that's not a realistic scenario.  I suspect that such IDs would be
used by computers (not humans), and would only be exchanged among computers
in some sort of semantic context; e.g., within the context of a DwC2 XML
file, nestled between appropriate tags:

<GlobalUniqueIdentifier>92AB5B37-70E9-4f05-9E97-CBABD08513ED</GlobalUniqueId
entifier>

...these themselves nestled within further context tags.

I tend to agree -- which is why I preferred DOIs (and increasingly, LSIDs)
to MAC ID's (which show up all over the place in all sorts of contexts).
Even still, though, I think we'll find that all electronic exchanges
involving GUIDs of which we speak, will do so within an evident context.

Yes, but I initially preferred DOIs to LSIDs because there tends to be less
"context baggage" associated with them. My sense of DOIs is that each
institution would not create its own DOI category; but rather there would be
a single agreed-upon DOI category that is independent of any particular
institution (with all the potential for political baggage an
institution-specified context might afford).

More power to you (and GBIF, and the future of DiGIR)!  But in my view, it
should still be seen only as a temporary solution, until we can get our acts
together with more specific (and less information-contingent) ID systems.

I believe you are in the majority on this.  But when I think it all through,
I still feel that consolidation of GUID issuance will be more advantageous
in the long term.

If I read you correctly, I gather you are saying that the issuance of
numbers would be distributed and isolated, but the issuers would fall under
a centralized authority.  I'm not sure I understand why this system is
necessarily advantageous over a centralized issuer.

With the level of coordination required, you might as well go for the "brass
ring" (in my opinion).  But maybe what I see as the "brass ring" is seen as
a dud to others.

Actually, I was talking about Taxonomic Names, specifically -- but if Names
are considered as represented by a subset of Concepts (as I hope they will
be), then it's the same GUID pool.

I agree with all of this, but it seems that the infrastructure you describe

would.

Hmmm...I'm not sure I follow.  If I interpret your word "resolver"
correctly, then I see no reason why BioCode.org LSIDs could only be resolved
by one server.  Is that what the DomainName component of a LSID is
specifically for?  That is, "go to this domain to resolve the meaning of
this LSID"?  I thought the DomainName component was simply to give
uniqueness to an LSID in the form of representing the issuer (analogous to
the function of InstitutionCode in DwC).  I see no reason why there couldn't
be dozens, or hundreds of mirrored caches of the complete dataset all over
the world, maintained automatically in synchrony with the "master" set
(which would presumably, but not necessarily, reside at BioCode.org). Any
one of the mirrors could resolve any BioCode.org LSID.  With such a system,
resolving an LSID would require that *any one* of potentially dozens of
mirrored servers to be functional.

If I understand you correctly, and an LSID is resolved only by the server at
the Domain embedded within the LSID, then a dataset containing a
heterogeneous assortment of LSIDs would need *all* of potentially dozens of
distributed servers to be functional.

In that case, I would vehemently oppose the use of LSIDs -- especially ones
issued from multiple sources, which rely on the issuer existing into
perpetuity.  It seems MUCH more feasible to me that the GUIDs only be used
within a prescribed context, than it would to require that all LSID issuers
exist into perpetuity, and be functional at all times that someone needs to
resolve the information associated with any particular ID value.

Embedding issuer context in a GUID makes sense to me.  Restricting
resolution of GUID to the embedded issuer *only*, seems like a very
dangerous system to me.

But it's not that simple, is it?  If there is an LSID:

urn:lsid:bishopmuseum.org:Specimen:1234567

and another LSID, to a completely different specimen:

urn:lsid:smithsonian.gov:Specimen:1234567

...then simply re-directing all bishopmuseum.org requests to Smiithsonian
wouldn't work....would it?  Or would Smithsonian recognize the domain and
deal with it accordingly?

It seems to me that a lot of complexity would disappear if we could all get
behind a single issuer of GUIDs, and mirror the capability to resolve those
GUIDs on dozens or hundreds of servers around the world, and only use the
GUIDs in a semantic context that is self-evident.

Actually, it's probably safe to say that all "name-bearing" Name+Reference
instances (i.e., original descriptions) are also, virtually by definition,
also "concept-bearing" Name+Reference instances.  So, not only would
name-bearing and concept-bearing Name+Reference instances be non-exclusive
of each other, it would probably be safe to think of name-bearing instances
as a subset (Subtype) of Concept-bearing instances, which themselves are a
subset (Subtype) of all Name+Reference instances.

My understanding is that it would be easy to develop a DOI-like system that
is not part of the fee-based DOI system, and I still find it appealing
because it could as simple as an integer ID and very basic context tag.

As for LSIDs -- If I understand correctly that the purpose of the
<DomainName> portion of the LSID is to point to the one (and only?) server
that can resolve the ID, then all of a sudden I don't like them at all.  If
it's true that the embedded Domain portion of an LSID *requires* that the
domain exist for as long as the GUID exists in order for the GUID to be
useful, then I definitely have reservations.  If, on the other hand, the
Domain portion can be seen as representing the issuer (somewhat analogous to
the function of "InstitutionCode" in DwC), and could be resolved by any
server set up to deal with the <namespace> part of the LSID, then I'm much
less concerned.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the use of the word "issuers", but in my mind,
the issuer's job is only to provide a guaranteed-unique set of ID's.  It
would not, necessarily, be the location where the ID is applied to its
associated data.

In Donald's PowerPoint file, he made reference to "mechanisms for data
providers to request and use blocks of LSIDs from central service".  Here's
how I imagine a system would work:

GBIF (or some other central entity) establishes a service that can generate
unique <objectID> numbers within its own LSID context.  The same service
also maintains a complete set of data associated with each <objectID>.
Major (and minor) institutions (essentially your set of "Trusted" entities)
would established mirrored copies of the complete set of all data (or,
perhaps, only a filtered subset of the complete data), but would not be able
to issue new GUIDs directly.  However, the mirrored sites could serve as
real-time "pass-through" to the central sight so as to be functionally able
to provide new GUIDs in real time, by retrieving them directly (in real
time) from the central server.  Also, the mirrored sites would all maintain
synchrony of their copies of the data with the central "master" copy, on a
realistic time frame (e.g., every 24 hours, or on-demand if a data provider
chose to initiate a synchronization command).

If a curator of a local institution's data needed to assign a new batch of
numbers for a new set of specimens, the curator would issue a request to the
central server (or via one of mirrored sites as a pass-through request) for
a block of N numbers.  The central server would never re-issue those same
numbers again to anyone else.  But those numbers remain "empty" until the
curator assigns them to data, and uploads that data either to the central
server or to one of the mirrors.  In other words, even though the numbers
are "issued" by a central server, they are applied to real data only by
local curators.

A big issue, of course, is control over editing of data associated with a
given GUID.  In the case of specimens, the central server and mirrored sites
could (perhaps at the discretion of the data curator who initially requested
the number) restrict subsequent editing of those data to a defined set of
password-protected user accounts.  In the case of more public data, such as
taxon names and publications, the control of data editing would be less
restrictive (e.g., either full accessible by the public, or accessible to
anyone who goes to the trouble to register themselves as a taxonomist with
the central server or with any of the mirrored sites).

Maybe this approach would not be practical for specimen data -- but I think
it would be the optimal approach for taxon data.  Perhaps those two
fundamentally different kinds of data (owned, vs. public domain) need
fundamentally different approaches to GUID issuance and assignment?

I'd have to think this through some more.  Leaving it too open might lead to
a plethora of (potentially overlapping, but not quite equivalent)
NameSpaces, which seems like it could turn into a real mess, really quickly.
Centralized ID systems such as social security numbers in the U.S.,
telephone numbers, etc. definitely have some advantage over totally open
systems.  I suppose that the pool of NS's would be self-cleaning simply by
use or non-use....but I still wonder how much better this approach would be
over the status quo.

Again, I'll have to think about this some more.  I certainly don't think
that the "system" should be incapable of dealing with new classes -- sort of
like how anyone can develop their own Federation Schema and use DiGIR to
establish specific information networks.  But I'd hate to see a breakdown in
the global transmission of biodiversity information simply because different
subgroups establish their own special-needs, non-mutually-compatible classes
for dealing with essentially the same kinds of information (especially if
they do not also conform to a generalized international standard).

O.K., in that case I misunderstood the meaning of "identifiers".  All
historical identifiers (e.g., catalog numbers for specimens) should be
maintained, preserved, and cross-referenced to GUIDs just like any other
metadata about the physical object.  I think of catalog numbers not so much
as unique identifiers, but as "labels" -- not altogether unlike taxonomic
names. In the databases I manage, I do not use catalog numbers as
identifiers -- the computer generates the UID, which is never seen, read,
written, or typed by a human.  That's how I'd like to see the sorts of GUIDs
we're discussing be implemented -- i.e., for the benefit of
computer-computer data exchange; not human-human data exchange or
human-computer/computer-human data exchange.

Agreed -- but I still think of these as "soft" identifiers, because
CatalogNumber values can change over time, in certain circumstances.  GUIDs
should *never* need to be changed (even if the institution that issued them
vanishes without a trace from the face of the Earth).

I agree the revision information *can* be helpful in dealing with errors;
but I don't see that function as being integral to the assignment of GUID
values.

For what it's worth, the databases I have developed for my institution are
designed to log every change made to every field (except
performance-enhancing, purely derivative fields), including what the
previous value was, who made the change, and when the change was made.  When
records are deleted, a "snapshot" of the value of every non-null field is
logged, including the time the record was deleted, and by whom.  The reason
I say all of this is to underscore that my stance on not including
versioning IDs as part of a GUID system is NOT from lack of appreciation for
the value of preserving edit histories (something I clearly value very, very
much -- given that the total diskspace occupied by my edit logs exceeds the
total diskspace occupied by the "real" data!)

In closing, I apologize to those who find my overly-long posts on this topic
to be an annoyance.  I also am starting to wonder:  is this the appropriate
email forum to have this discussion?

Aloha,

Yes, certainly, a GUID within the context of an XML document is pretty
well defined by the schema, dtd or just it's loose association with
other elements in the document.

But what about if one appears in a journal article, a citation in a
policy document, etc?  It would be nice to be able to provide a unique
identifier as perhaps a footnote for a scientific name mentioned in a
document.  Or perhaps a system might be developed that provided an LSID
for a DiGIR query document- so the dataset could be completely recreated
just be hitting on the LSID (yes, one is under construction).  One could
imagine simply passing the LSID to another infrastructure that say,
estimated potential distribution, or highlighted relevant news reports
from an AP feed mentioning the species for which the query was created.
  Using a simple, meaningless GUID buys us none of this potential, and
forces us to always use a wrapper to provide a contextual basis on how
to interpret the identifier.

Well...that's partly why I emphasized that I think GUIDs should be for
computer-computer data exchange only.  But even if printed for a pair of
human eyes to read, surely there would be *some* stated context.  E.g.,
"ITIS TSN 1234567"; "BPBM 123456"; "GBIF Specimen ID 9876543"; "ICZN NameID
92AB5B37-70E9-4f05-9E97-CBABD08513ED"; etc....

How hard would it be in such cases to include within the Methods section of
the document, something to the effect of "All taxon IDs listed in this paper
refer to GBIF Specimen ID's, which can be resolved at gbif.net".  If the
problem is one involving a pair of human eyes reading a number, then the
problem can be solved in the context of a pair of human eyes reading the
context.

I guess my question is, why *must* the wrapper be integral to the ID itself?
Why can't the contextual basis be established around the ID, at the time the
ID is presented/transferred, as needed?  If the cost of embedding the
context within the GUID is that all links to, say, Bishop Museum ichthyology
GUIDs for specimens become useless if the collection is transfered to
another institution and the embedded DomainName terminated, then I say put
the burden of context  establishment on the ID exchange system
("presentation layer"), rather than embedded within the ID itself.

Maybe.  Perhaps for individual records there is no need for a resolvable
identifier to a single object, and using a MAC type guid there makes
some sense.  But if we go to the trouble of making GUIDs, why not make
the useful as well?

Yes, that would be the way they are created - the DOI category would be
assigned by the governing agency (probably DOI.org).  Then the baggage,
the unique part, would be up to the data providers or some other authority.

Because there's no single point of failure, it is more scalable, and in
the (unlikely) event the centralized authority no longer exists, it
would be a fairly trivial matter to delegate root authority to another
tusted party.

Not sure what you mean here- If Joe enters a citation someplace and Rich
uses it's LSID within a Taxonomic Object he entered, why does it have to
be in the same pool?  As long as the LSID resolved to the appropriate
object, all would be good.

Yeah, but it really concerns me having a single point of failure for

How an LSID is resolved is described in detail in the document:

http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?lifesci/2003-12-02

Section 8.3 describes the use of DNS for resolution.

Basically, the LSID client:

1. Parses the LSID urn:lsid:DN:NS:ID[:Rev]
2. Using DNS, locate the SVR record for DN, which points to the service
3. Using DNS again, resolve the location of the service
4. Once you have the service endpoint, basically ask it for the object
with NS:ID:Rev

That's a gross simplification, and it appears that the LSID definition
now treats DNS resolution as one resolution mechanism, rather than the
only one.

Yeah, but once again - if the single issuer no longer exists, then
everything is gone.  That would be a real drag.

So formalize that a little and you might have something more
consistently machine parsable like: ITIS.ORG:TSN:1234567;
BPBM.EDU:something:123456;GBIF.ORG:Specimen:9876543, ...

Add in the system identifier for resolution (urn:lsid:...) and you have
LSIDs.  The result is a far more consistent, legible and widely useful
mechanism for referencing objects.  Allowing an author to arbitrarily
provide the context for identifiers gets us little further along.

Have you seen how LSIDs and DOIs are being used in electronic publications?

Sure, but do that consistently, by all authors?  And do it in a way that
is without ambiguity?  Machine parsable (for electronic publication)?
Easily resuable in other documents?

It must be so that it can be reused outside the original context of the
document that contained the identifier.  I believe there are mechanisms
in the LSID spec for dealing with this problem - but I need to go back
through it to be sure.

Nope.  Well, assuming the contributing datasets haven't been modified,
the content will be the same set of records.  If collections supported
versioning, then perhaps one day it might be possible to always return
exactly the same data...

All the system I mentioned does (will do) is assoicate an LSID with a
query document (and the target datasets).  Resolving the LSID actually
returns the query document, which can then be resolved by the DiGIR network.

Perhaps.  But what about if an insitution wants to provide IDs for more
than just specimen or name objects?  Should we always rely on a single
authority to provide a mechanism for doing that? I don't think that
would go very far.

The DN portion is meant to be resolvable by the DNS system.  So yes,
there is a dependency on the continued existence of the DN, but is can
be set up to be resolved by any LSID service endpoint.

If we use the MAC approach + a context such as an LSID or DOI form, then
  there is absolutely no need for a central issuing agency.  If data
providers are more careful about assuring they meet requirements about
their identifiers, then again there is no need for a central issuer.

Again, just use a MAC based GUID inside an LSID context.  If you have
any MS dev tools on your machine type "guidgen" and the command prompt.
  Voila!  Globally unique identifiers.  No matter how many times you
push the "New GUID" button.

That's why there needs to be some agreement over the issuance of namespaces.

Bah.  That's the whole point of this - to facilitate data exchange.  If
a small subgroup wants to start exchanging data in an abbreviated
format, so what?  As long as the identifiers being used are able to
resolve the type of object being passed around, and the objects conform
to their definitions, it shouldn't be a problem.  By initially
establishing a robust framework for Scientific Names and perhaps
specimen data / collections, then there will be little need for others
to recreate new ways to represent that data.  The benefits of a robust
reliable representation and provision of cheap, effective software tools
will hopefully overcome the steep learning curve needed to even
understand what's in some of these schemas.

But if I want to say to you, hey look at this specimen xxx while we're
chatting from around the world using an instant messenger while
collaborating on some project, would't it be nice to just be able to
type in lsid:mymuseum.org:specimen:1234 and have your client retrieve
that exact data and associated metadata directly?  A trivial example but
one that can form the foundation of some cool stuff for data exchange
and interaction.  I thought that was the whole point of these GUID
things.  But maybe I'm mistaken?

Wasn't trying to convince you....just signaling that you had yet to convince

O.K., I can see that.  But in the world I described, the only affect of a
failure would be an inability to retrieve new IDs -- all existing ID's would
still be resolvable at any of the dozens or hundreds of mirror sites.
Moreover, I would assume that the server that issued the numbers would be
designed to be as reliable as possible (think NYSE).  In the event that the
centralized authority no longer exists, it would be, as you say, a trivial
matter to delegate number issuance to another "trusted" mirror site.

Also, what of my point that a dataset containing ID's with heterogenous
sources would allow *ALL* sources to be single points of failure?  Is it not
true that an LSID would require that the issuing domain be online in order
to retrieve the data associated with the ID?  So if my dataset included IDs
from 15 issuing domains, all 15 would need to be active at the time I run my
query in order to get a complete return of data?  This seems like an even
less robust system.

No....Reference IDs (I assume by "citation", you mean what I mean when I say
"Reference"?) would be a different pool from Names.

What I meant was, in my world "Name" Id's would be drawn from the same pool
of Name+Reference IDs that Concept IDs would be.  In other words, there
would be one pool of IDs for Name+Reference instances. A subset of these
would be Concept-bearing Name+Reference instances.  And a subset of the
Concept-bearing instances (sub-subset of Name+Reference instances) would be
Name-bearing instances. Those Name-bearing instances would be the "Name"
component of other Name+Reference instances.  It's a recursive relationship,
via well-defined subtypes. But this is an entirely separate topic of
discussion, having more to do with the question of "what is the essence of a
taxonomic concept", and "what is the essence of a taxonomic name" -- that is
tangential to the more general discussion at hand.

> Yeah, but it really concerns me having a single point of failure for
> such a critical system.

As I described above, it doesn't have to be a single point of failure, and
the only "failure" would be a delay in receiving new ID's.  And there could
be a defined "chain of command" such that if the primary server (ID issuer)
goes down, the calls are automatically re-routed to the next mirror in the
chain of command, which then automatically assumes authority for issuing
numbers....and so on down the chain.

I *think* I understand the fundamental differences in our perspective.  I
see the bioinformatics world operating more smoothly within a very specific,
well-understood and universally agreed-upon context.  You seem to prefer a
completely generic, self-describing system, that is not necessarily
restricted in scope to biology (correct?)  I understand your perspective,
and I certainly see its appeal -- I just think that the case-specific
implementation is even more appealing (to me, anyway).

O.K., this clears up a lot in my mind.  But what intrigues me now is: What
are the other (potential?) resolution mechanisms?

Obviously, my grasp of LSIDs was fundamentally flawed.  As much as the
"single-point failure" problem concerns you, the "must have all DNs within a
dataset containing multiple LSIDs active & online" concerns me.  In a sense,
it means there are many single-point failures that can impede data flow.

The specimens, presumably, wouldn't be gone -- they would simply move to a
new location.  And what happens when one specific specimen is transferred
from Museum "A" to Museum "B"?  Does it keep the original LSID (meaining
that the original Musuem must continue to maintain and update data for a
specimen it no longer owns)?  Or is it issued a new LSID by the receiving
institution, in which case the specimen now has more than one ID?  What
happens to a legacy dataset that still has a pointer to the old LSID?  Yes,
I can see work-arounds to all of these (mechanisms for auto-forwarding,
maintenance of indesx of duplicate LSIDs, etc.)  But when you add up all of
that sort of baggage, the
redundant-mirrored-central-ID-issuer-with-defined-chain-of-command-cascade
system seems easier to manage, more flexible, and more reliable.

Yes, but the difference would be that in my world, any one of many mirrored
sites could resolve GBIF.ORG:Specimen:9876543; whereas the LSID protocol you
described above requires the issuer to resolve it.

If it's human-human data exchange, it doesn't need to be consistent by all
authors.  ICZN requires new species-group names to be represented by a
holotype specimen. There are no rules about how an author indicates the
Holotype specimen -- only that it is done so more or less unambiguously.
Perhaps ICZN rules should be strengthened -- but the point is, human-human
communication of this sort works fairly well even without rigid rules for
consistency, and even tolerates a fair amount of ambiguity.

Machine parsable is another issue.  I see documents, as you describe them,
as a medium of human->human (or computer->human) information exchange.  If
the data exist electronically already, why pass them from machine to machine
via "dumbed-down" human-readable documents that need to be subsequently
re-interpreted by a machine?  Better to start teaching Kindergarteners to
read XML as though it were prose! :-)

It's getting late, but I'll try to send off a "Part II" before I call it a
night.

Aloha,

No -- we come together as a community to agree upon mechanisms for GUID
assignment and exchange among well-defined classes that we routinely wish to
share and aggregate information about (Specimen/Observations,
Names/Concepts/Assertions, References, Agents, and maybe a couple of
others). If Bishop Museum wanted to provide IDs for, say, Baseball cards, or
Star Wars memorabilia, or some other object type, then it would coordinate
with other holders of data relating to baseball cards [or perhaps trading
cars in general] or Star Wars memorabilia [or perhaps movie memorabilia in
general], and they would decide amongst themselves whether DOIs or LSIDs or
UUIDs, or MACs, or whatever make the most sense for their particular needs.

If Bishop Museum wanted to provide IDs for something like condition reports
of specimens over time, or changing dynamics of wild populations, or DNA
sequences, or Images, or any number of other objects that are relevant to
bioinformatics, then they would propose a new class of objects to TDWG,
along with an appropriate schema and recommend standards for implementation,
and other institutions with like-data would discuss the optimal approach to
dealing with those sorst of data. The "community" would debate the various
options in the context of integration with existing data exchange protocols,
etc., and a standard would emerge.

Don't get me wrong....the letter "G" is my favorite letter in DiGIR.  And
the more I think about it, the more I understand why you want the IDs to
have embedded context that can be resolved automatically, without any custom
tweaking to accomodate new classes of IDs.  But the costs (or at least my
perception of the costs) do tend to frighten me a bit.  It makes a lot more
sense for specimen data.  If Bishop Museum's server is down -- tough luck,
you can't have our data.  But I would *HATE* to rely on any one particular
server to get public-domain information like taxon names whenever I needed
it.  Yes, the single-point failure problem is real.  But there are
technological solutions to minimize those sorts of concerns (on an
intermittent basis) down to something indistinguishable from zero.  I don't
think I have ever gone to Google and found it down.  And there can be
redundancy built into the system.

So now let me ask you this:  Are the advantages of serving the GUID needs of
both specimens and taxon names via an identical, generalized GUID scheme
greater than the advantages of custom-tailoring the GUID scheme for each
different sort of data (owned, vs. public-domain)?  I think I already know
the short answer is "Yes", but I'm interested in the reasons (e.g., common
set of software tools to deal with both, etc.)

I think I need to learn more about LSIDs before forming too strong of an
opinion either for, or against them.

Agreed!  And that might be the better approach (for a lot of reasons).  My
only concern would be to what extent desktop database applications can uses
MAC values as primary keys (compared to using something like long integers)
efficiently and effectively, when manipulating large datasets in real time.
I guess this may be a trivial point in the grand scheme of things -- but
ultimately taxonomists will want to be able to work with large datasets on
their personal computers.

Yes, and this may be the best approach. MACs are scary for people to read,
but as I said before, people really shouldn't be reading them.

But in order to avoid having a bottleneck for data resolution at the point
of MAC issuance, you would need to get the data mirrored efficiently across
many servers. This could be done like DNS (as I undertand it), where the
changes propagate through a haphazard web of servers.  But I think I'd be
more comfortable having some sort of centralized hub or coordinator (like
GBIF) to ensure data mirroring is done efficiently and completely.  On this
point, I could very-well be persuaded to change my view.

No problem if they also continue to provide the relevant bits via the
"conventional" means.  But BIG problem if everyone in Europe gravitates
towards one conventional standard, and everyone in the U.S. gravitates
towards a different flavor, and everyone in Asia gravitates towards yet a
different flavor.  I'm thinking Cell Phone standards, NTSC vs. PAL,
competing HDTV standards, DVD+R vs. DVD-R, etc., etc.

Already we have some problems in dealing with the fact that ICZN and ICBN do
not have perfectly compatible Codes of nomenclature.  Imagine if different
geographic regions adopted their own versions of nomenclatural Codes; or if
the Fish people got together and decided they wanted slight different rules
to apply to their names.  Such freedom would not likely contribute favorably
to scientific progress.  Taxonomists conform to respective Codes of
nomenclature not because they are perfect in how they establish names, but
because the community has converged on a single standard.

But such a chat would certainly provide an opportunity to suggest context.
Wouldn't it be easier if I said "Hey, go to GBIF and look up SpecimenID
1234"? This scenario seems to apply equally to both of our world
perspectives. The only advantage I would see for LSIDs in this case is if I
forgot to mention to my colleague that I wanted her to look up a specimen,
rather than a taxon name, and just told her to "look up 1234".  Not likely
in a human-human conversation.

Yes, I certainly agree that this is the whole point of GUIDs!  What I don't
understand is why LSIDs (with domain-active requirements) fulfill this more
effectively (all costs and benefits considered) than other GUID systems.

> Except in the somewhat bizarre case when you need the old version of the

Yeah, but as you say this is a bizarre case.  In those bizarre cases, you
can send an email to the data manager and ask for a report on the edit
history of the record.  If they got it, they got it. But I don't see this as
being such a routine need that it needs to be accomdated-for by the GUID
system (unless, as I suggested earlier, that it was otherwise completely
transparent and could be ignored without consequence).

If it moves, let me know where it goes.  Right now, it's time for bed....

eh??? MAC addresses /are/ just long integers.

Once reduced to a digital representation, /everything/ is just a long
integer. Hence in the end, for machine use, the differences between
different ID schemes come down to a very few criteria, all having to do
with programming ease and the effective computability of each of the
assertions about the acquisition of IDS and manipulations of them that
are required.]. No two schemes are distinguishable solely on the basis
that one of them appears to have a representation as integers and one of
them appears not to. What's more interesting is: for a given scheme, to
what representation other than as a long integer can you reduce the ID
and how does that help with the programming about, and administration
of, the identifiers, what is the scope of "Global" in the acronym GUID,
and what needs to be specified to convert the ID to another ID of
importance to the enterprise (e.g. converting a specimen guid to a
(museum,room,drawer,pin)tuple).

For example, MAC addresses were designed to be globally unique only
among devices on the same wire. They were historically assigned in
blocks to manufacturers of network interface cards, and the only
motivation to have no repetition was to insure that the NICs of two
manufacturers could be connected to the same wire. In fact, MAC
addresses are now routinely programmable and rarely designate some
worldwide distinction between two specific physical objects. Indeed,
anybody who buys a consumer router for home use is often---and sometimes
unknown to them---exposing to their ISP a MAC address for the router
hardware that is actually the MAC address of one of the NICs on their
internal network. Subject to the very criticism David V. has leveled
against them---lack of context /offered in the spec/---MAC addresses as
used on networks require for resolution into physical objects an Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) that depends on the wire protocol. For
example, http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc826.html is the ARP for ethernet,

Little Bit O'History: Dave Plummer's address on RFC826 was Symbolics
Inc., one of two companies making Lisp Machines in the early eighties.
For reasons /really/ irrelevant to this discussion, Symbolics sold the
first and only brand of laser printer commercially available, a wet
toner device briefly manufactured by Canon. It came with nothing but a
bit mapped raster image processer and could barely be lifted by two
people. Within a year it was replaced by dry toner technology whose
general architecture is what laser printers look like today. At
Interleaf, Inc., I wrote some driver software for it. On the wall we
displayed my first output, meant to be some line art, and which we
titled "Blizzard in Antarctica". The second was titled "Coal Mine at
Midnight".

Sorry....I meant "Long" integer in the sense of DB applications, which are
32-bit (4 byte) integers.  I had read once that MAC-style GUIDs are not
optimized on desktop DB applications for use as primary keys.  However,
having just done some Google-snooping, I can't confirm that (in fact, if
anything, I've found the opposite).  So I'm starting to think that my
concerns about using about using MAC-style IDs as primary keys are probably
a Red Herring.

Agreed -- but aren't DB applications optimized to utilize certain kinds of
ID schemes more effectively/efficiently than other kinds of ID schemes?

Many thanks for the enlightening (and interesting) insights on MAC IDs.  It
always amazes me that, though I may understand computers better than 95% of
people on Earth, the gap between me and the top 1% is much larger than the
gap between me and, say, the fish in my aquarium.

I think the important parts of this discussion surround the functional
parameters of the GUIDs for biological objects:

1) Should issuance of IDs be controlled from a single source; or freely
created by anyone with a computer, anywhere, anytime; or something
in-between?

2) Is it important that all biological objects use the same scheme for ID
sourcing, or is it advantageous to chose a scheme optimal for each class of
object (e.g., privately owned and managed specimen data, vs. publicly owned
and managed taxonomic nomenclature data)?

3) Should contextual information about how to resolve the ID be embedded
within the ID itself, or should the responsibility of context be relegated
to presentation protocols?

4) What is the greater risk to information flow in our context: reliance on
a single-point source for all the data resolution, or reliance on many
sources functioning simultaneously in order to resolve all of the data? What
options for mitigating impediments to data resolution are available to each
of these approaches?

To provide another context for GUID's and LSID's, the CIPRes project (via
Dan Miranker)  is considering LSID's as the glue (there is probably a
better metaphor) for backpointers to datasources for taxa/characters/states
from the next version of Treebase.  That is, if you deposit a Nexus file
(which will obviously no longer be a monolithic 'file', but an XML
document) in TreeBase and have images/movies/voxel data sets to illustrate
a character state, a LSID will provide a source for exploring additional
supporting documentation for that cell of the matrix.  SDD fits into this
communication in ways that are clear only at a pretty abstract level, but
are involved in standardizing the exchange of data (mostly morphological)
between character sources and CIPRes.  We also imagine that a LSID will
provide a link to the taxon concept invoked for a row in the matrix and
presumably for specimens used to make the observations.

The interlinking of biodiversity and phylogenetic data in this context
suggests to this observer (somewhere between Richard Pyle and his aquarium
fish in terms of understanding), that a single source of ID's would not
scale.  It also strongly argues for LSID's over meaningless keys as
essential to projects like CIPRes, which only want to store the logic for
resolving a URN (and in real time for users of the data) that could refer
to a bunch of different kinds of things.

Hope that is clear (enough).

Thanks, Julian!

As I stew over this stuff, I am ever so gradually warming back up to LSID,
even with their (apparent) handicaps.  At least for "owned" data (specimens,
etc.).  I'd still like to know what happens (in terms of LSIDs) when one
museum gives a specimen to another museum. This sort of think happens very
routinely.  Less routine, but by no means unheard of, are cases where an
entire collection is transferred from one institution to another. I'm still
trying to contemplate the implications for "public domain" data (Reference
citations, Taxon Names, published Taxon Concepts, etc.), and it still gives
me gastric Lepidopterans.

Ha!  Nope -- I think you're somewhere in the much broader gap; between me
and Bill Gates.

Subject:      Re: Globally Unique Identifier

I believe a centralised system that maintins and assigns the LSIDs would be
too large a job for one organisation and would create a bottle-neck in the
system (where every call/request or assignment of IDs will need to be
passed through one web server located a GBIF).

The reality of the data that will be transferred using the SDD format, is
that it is quite decentralised and is represented in quite different ways
at each data source.  I think therefore it should be up the orgainisation
containing the data to provide a LSID and resolve these LSIDs.  For example
we are considering an LSID and a MAC GUID for the unique ID of our
taxonomic name data here at Landcare Research.  Which would be something
like URN:LSID:LandcareResearch:TaxonName:86BA062A-ADC6-4516-956F-
34CDA0F465EC.  With a centralised system this would not be allowed - ie the
LSID would probably be limited to integers, which would then need to be
reslove at the individual organisation to find the matching data.

Having a non-centralised system would put more work on each organisation
involved, and create problems when data is moved, or organisations are
closed, but this just means that procedures need to be put in place to
handle such situations.  It is possible that there may be intermediate
services that provide the LSID resolution for a bunch of databases/data
sources and serve up this data to those who request it.

I also think there is a bit of a tie between the authority name of the LSID
and the URL that is used for obtaining the data.  This doesnt need to be
so.  The would be the job of the central Resolver would be to match the
authority name to the url for obtaining the data.  So the authority name in
the LSID could just be any name.

I find nothing in the LSID current(?) proposed recommendation
http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?lifesci/2003-12-02 that specifies that
the "object identification" part of an LSID may not be a string of hex
digits and dashes. (Though I continue to fail to see why people are so
in love with these).

However, what is the case is that the complete LSID must be globally
unique and /persistent/.


FWIW, the recommendation is that the authority identification should
normally be a URL, e.g. landcareresearch.co.nz,  or else the
corresponding  name be registered with the appropriate authority.

It isn't so. The authority name is the /issuing/ authority. It's an
authority for the LSID, not for its resolution or the underlying data.
The obligation on the issuer is only that the complete name must be
syntactically correct and globally unique forever. The obligation on the
party receiving the LSID is that it must never be assigned to another
datum [see para below beginning "This brings up"]. However, several
different LSIDs can be assigned to the same datum.

Actually, in the proposed recommendation, the LSID resolution protocol
does not return data, but rather a list of data retrieval services which
know about the given LSID. The client calls one of these to fetch data
or metadata corresponding to the LSID.

This brings up  a point I may have missed in this discussion: LSIDs are
designed to give an identifier to /data/ not to physical objects. This
probably means that a fully compliant use of LSIDs for "specimens" will
be assigned to specimen records, not to specimen objects. This is good,
because if a physical object is moved it presumably gets a new specimen
record, which record, perhaps, has some metadata that tells the curation
history of the underlying object, including its previous LSIDs.
Seems like the analog of taxonomic synonomy to me....

Probably TDWG and GBIF should be examining what metadata to provide on
"TDWG compliant LSIDs" in various contexts, especially specimen records.




>So the authority name in

Not if compliant with the LSID proposal. It must itself have some global
uniqueness guarantees, e.g. suitable registration. See above.

Hi,
I found the PowerPoint document from Donald really helpfull on some of the
discussed issues. Unfortunately referring to it is a little difficult
because the pages does not contain a unique identier :)

But first some real-world experience with the 'GUID' used today in GBIF
specimen network.
The combination InstitutionCode, CollectionCode and CatalogNumber was chosen
for that. Problems experienced last year:
-the 'GUID combination' is not enforced and therefore not always used
-Some collections belong to 2 or more Institutions or to none
-If part of the collection moves to another institute, the guid combination
is changed for that part.
-The InstitutionCode should be unique, and providers where asking what to do
if the code they wanted to use was already chosen, and who decides which
institute may use an institutioncode if two institutes want to use it. There
is no body responsible for that and there are no rules: the first Institute
can claim a code, or the biggest or the most well known??
-In different science areas different InstitutionCodes within one
Organisation where in use, which one to choose.
-This 'GUID' can only be used for specimen, not for other life science
objects.

Now let's look at LSID syntax:
urn:lsid:authority:namespace:object_identifier (:revision_number)
About  the first part; authority:
It is naturally to want this to be unique. Therefore we can expect the same
problems as mentioned above, plus unclearity about the difference
issuing_authority vs. current_authority for the data.
The problems with authority are important for the involved authorities only,
not for the rest of the life science community. So discussions about it and
establishing an authority that takes decisions in political conflicts are a
waste of time.
We can solve it by using a unique number only and maintaining a list that
gives information about each number. It should be clear that this are only
the initial issuing authority/authorities.

About the second part; namespace:
Things like 'Specimen' or 'Experiment'. In contrast with the first part,
problems with this part are interesting for the whole lifescience community
because applications will want to use this to decide whether the data can be
used for a specific application. Standardisation of namespaces is necessary.
I think it should be devided in two parts (not currently present in LSID)
like MIME type image/jpeg etc: 'observation/abcd' or 'specimen/darwincore'
for example.
If we look at the Donalds PPT we see that in model 1: LSID assigned
centrally, the namespace is chosen centrally and by model2: LSID assigned by
each provider, the provider is free to choose one. Even language variations
of naming a namespace can already give problems, so this is why I strongly
favor a central mechanism here for assigning LSIDs, unless the provider is
somehow forced to use a certain namespace class. The potential bottleneck
problem is not really an issue I think (see also DNS mechanisms). If we
choose central mechanism the issuing authority will always be GBIF (or do we
need different authorities for different parts of Life Science?) so no
problems with that also in this case.

The third part; object id: no problems there.

The last part; revision id: whether you need it depends: do you give the
physical objects a GUID or the data records? With the first choice you do
not need a revision number because the physical object will not change (or
do they with living collections?).
At first I thought that a GUID should be put on physical object: if you are
looking for data, you are looking for data about a certain physical object,
the source of the data is not (very) important. The same data elements in
different sources about the same object should be equal, else there are
errors. Donald's PPT gives the example that someone wants to refer to a LSID
in a publication as a source. In that case you want to refer to a data
source with a certain version. Then you need to give a GUID to the data and
also you need revisions. Data is not persistent, it changes all the time.
Giving a persistent identifier to it is very difficult and not many data
systems have full revisions support. If a GUID for a 'physical object' is
chosen, a thing like a species name or author name or country should not get
a GUID. These are more a kind of attributes: most data will use one or more
species names as 'metadata'. There needs to be central datasource for each
of these 'metadata', like a NameBank for species names (with its own ID). I
am not sure whether LSID was designed for a GUID to data or to physical
objects. The use of namespace and object id instead of databasename and
recordid seems to indicate that it was designed for physical objects, but
why then the optional revision id? Instead of a revision id you can also
assign a new GUID with every change, but then how to point to a new version
from an old version of data (if you have the GUID of the old version, how to
get the GUID of the new one).

Requirements in Donald's PPT:
-if a GUID is on a physical object, the GUID must not refer uniquely to a
single data element, it must only be unique itself. It is also not a
requirement in LSID specification. There will be overlap between the
objects, so an object can belong to more then one IDs. For instance a
researcher can have its own ID and also belong to the ID of the Institute he
is working for. The data for overlapping elements like researcher name must
be equal.
-I would restrict the identifiers to life science objects.

Issues to be resolved in Donald's PPT:
It would be beneficial to maintain the GUID in the datasource itself (at
least for the owner of the datasource), but not absolutely necessary. I see
GUID in data records as a 'tightly coupled' model (which requires some work
for existing databases). I can imagine also a 'loosely coupled' model where
provider software is modified to get the identifier from a central server
(or mirror).

Perhaps it would be useful to look at the issues being discussed about a bio
identifier/locator/GUID in comparison to the same things that are needed for
Internet communications. How do you find a web page in a directory on a
server somewhere in the world? The solution used by our Internet forefathers
was to create layers and have standards and standard-handling methods at
each layer.

To connect to a web page across the Internet involves multiple standards,
standard bodies, handlers, forwarders, duplicaters, etc.  The entire chain
of events works because there are systems and people all working their part
of the network everyday.  It's not just a single authority running
everything and it's not just every institution for themselves.  It's a
coordinated combination approach.

This is going to be an overly simplistic description of the Internet (and
probably inaccurate in some details) but I hope it conveys the analogy.

The most unique thing of all on the Ethernet is the MAC address which is
assigned to the NIC at the lowest layer. Just numbers and letters. Only the
computers and network hardware deal with this number.

Under the TCP/IP protocol for Ethernet communication, an IP address is
assigned to the NIC/MAC address. Just numbers with no meaning.  Sometimes
humans actually use the IP address, but it is mostly used by the computers.

IP addresses have to be unique world-wide to make the Internet work. The
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN- www.icann.org)
provides that uniqueness by assigning all the IP numbers in unique blocks or
ranges of numbers to "Internet Registries".  There are Regional, National
and Local Internet Registries that subdivide and "license" IP addresses to
ISPs, who in turn license IP addresses to organizations. Some organizations
are so big that they bypass any ISP.  So, there is a heirarchy of how the
"unique identifiers" are managed.  There is in fact a central authority, but
it delegates to decentralized authorities. Is there an analogy for BioGUIDs
to have a central body who divvies out the unique numbers (like IP
addresses) to decentralized bodies or large organizations?

Since IP addresses are hard to memorize (and so too would be a BioGUID),
"domain names" are used. Starting with a domain name, you can first find the
name and/or IP address of a device, called the Domain Name Server, that can
locate the IP address of other computers.  This is a form of indirect
addressing.  ICANN also manages the top-level namespace for the Internet.
They decide what the valid domain "extensions" are (like .com, .uk) so that
everybody, everywhere knows where to look them up.  Then, the domain name
extensions are separated among the Regional, National, and Local Interent
Registries around the world.  There is a scheme for where to find the IP
addresses for every domain extension (e.g. .com is on the ARIN registry,
.com.uk is on the ).

Then there is a layer of Domain Registrars who have been accredited by ICANN
to assign domain names for the domain extensions - e.g. tdwg.org.

The domain name registrars are told by the owner of the domain where to find
their particular Domain Name Servers which may be many to enable redundancy
- Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, etc.  These redundant Domain Name Servers
synchronize with each other at particular times of day and may be located
all around the world.  They are the main "switchboard" for a particular
organizations computer names and associated IP addresses.

Then the individual organization can create multiple computers for the
domain name - e.g. www.tdwg.org - and add them to the Domain Name Server
listing.  There can be many computers for a domain, for instance:
info.tdwg.org, www2.tdwg.org, myname.tdwg.org.  Each of these can be a
different computer with a different IP address.  The redundant Domain Name
Servers all contain the list of all these names and what IP addresses they
are.

So, it all works through a series of layers, each connected to the other
with indirect references.  At the bottom there are the unique and cryptic IP
and MAC numbers.  In between them and the humans are the layering of names.
And the methods for changing names.  You can start with an IP address and
find the domain it is in and the computer name assigned to it.  Or, you can
start with a name like www.tdwg.org and find its IP address.

The players in the Internet networking fabric all now play by these layered
rules.  They all know them and follow them in order to keep the Internet
running.  This stuff happens out of sight to everyone but the networking
people and we all take it for granted and assume it is simple.  But, it's
invisible not because it's simple, but rather because it's disciplined.  And
a lot of hardware devices have been constructed to follow and enforce the
rules.

In our discussions of how a BioGUID would be implemented - how assigned, how
managed, how identified and located, how made resilient to failure - we need
to be mindful that there is probably not going to be a simple, this way or
that way solution.  It probably needs to be organized into layers of
abstraction, but it will also need to be disciplined.

I think we will need something like BioICANN with BioDomainRegistries,
BioDomainExtensions, BioDomains and BioDNSs that provide the access paths to
the BioGUIDs.

who divvies out the unique numbers (like IP addresses) to decentralized =
bodies or large organizations?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Since IP addresses are hard to memorize (and so too =
would be a BioGUID), &quot;domain names&quot; are used. Starting with a =
domain name, you can first find the name and/or IP address of a device, =
called the Domain Name Server, that can locate the IP address of other =
computers.&nbsp; This is a form of indirect addressing.&nbsp; ICANN =
also manages the top-level namespace for the Internet. They decide what =
the valid domain &quot;extensions&quot; are (like .com, .uk) so that =
everybody, everywhere knows where to look them up.&nbsp; Then, the =
domain name extensions are separated among the Regional, National, and =
Local Interent Registries around the world.&nbsp; There is a scheme for =
where to find the IP addresses for every domain extension (e.g. .com is =
on the ARIN registry, .com.uk is on the ).&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Then there is a layer of Domain Registrars who have =
been accredited by ICANN to assign domain names for the domain =
extensions - e.g. tdwg.org.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The domain name registrars are told by the owner of =
the domain where to find their particular Domain Name Servers which may =
be many to enable redundancy - Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, etc.&nbsp; =
These redundant Domain Name Servers synchronize with each other at =
particular times of day and may be located all around the world.&nbsp; =
They are the main &quot;switchboard&quot; for a particular =
organizations computer names and associated IP addresses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Then the individual organization can create multiple =
computers for the domain name - e.g. www.tdwg.org - and add them to the =
Domain Name Server listing.&nbsp; There can be many computers for a =
domain, for instance: info.tdwg.org, www2.tdwg.org, =
myname.tdwg.org.&nbsp; Each of these can be a different computer with a =
different IP address.&nbsp; The redundant Domain Name Servers all =
contain the list of all these names and what IP addresses they =
are.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>So, it all works through a series of layers, each =
connected to the other with indirect references.&nbsp; At the bottom =
there are the unique and cryptic IP and MAC numbers.&nbsp; In between =
them and the humans are the layering of names.&nbsp; And the methods =
for changing names.&nbsp; You can start with an IP address and find the =
domain it is in and the computer name assigned to it.&nbsp; Or, you can =
start with a name like www.tdwg.org and find its IP =
address.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The players in the Internet networking fabric all now =
play by these layered rules.&nbsp; They all know them and follow them =
in order to keep the Internet running.&nbsp; This stuff happens out of =
sight to everyone but the networking people and we all take it for =
granted and assume it is simple.&nbsp; But, it's invisible not because =
it's simple, but rather because it's disciplined.&nbsp; And a lot of =
hardware devices have been constructed to follow and enforce the =
rules.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In our discussions of how a BioGUID would be =
implemented - how assigned, how managed, how identified and located, =
how made resilient to failure - we need to be mindful that there is =
probably not going to be a simple, this way or that way solution.&nbsp; =
It probably needs to be organized into layers of abstraction, but it =
will also need to be disciplined.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I think we will need something like BioICANN with =
BioDomainRegistries, BioDomainExtensions, BioDomains and BioDNSs that =
provide the access paths to the BioGUIDs.</FONT></P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>I found the PowerPoint document from Donald really =
helpfull on some of the discussed issues. Unfortunately referring to it =
is a little difficult because the pages does not contain a unique =
identier :)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>But first some real-world experience with the 'GUID' =
used today in GBIF specimen network. The combination InstitutionCode, =
CollectionCode and CatalogNumber was chosen for that. Problems =
experienced last year: -the 'GUID combination' is not enforced and =
therefore not always used -Some collections belong to 2 or more =
Institutions or to none -If part of the collection moves to another =
institute, the guid combination is changed for that part. -The =
InstitutionCode should be unique, and providers where asking what to do =
if the code they wanted to use was already chosen, and who decides =
which institute may use an institutioncode if two institutes want to =
use it. There is no body responsible for that and there are no rules: =
the first Institute can claim a code, or the biggest or the most well =
known?? -In different science areas different InstitutionCodes within =
one Organisation where in use, which one to choose. -This 'GUID' can =
only be used for specimen, not for other life science =
objects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Now let's look at LSID syntax: =
urn:lsid:authority:namespace:object_identifier (:revision_number) =
About&nbsp; the first part; authority: It is naturally to want this to =
be unique. Therefore we can expect the same problems as mentioned =
above, plus unclearity about the difference issuing_authority vs. =
current_authority for the data. The problems with authority are =
important for the involved authorities only, not for the rest of the =
life science community. So discussions about it and establishing an =
authority that takes decisions in political conflicts are a waste of =
time. We can solve it by using a unique number only and maintaining a =
list that gives information about each number. It should be clear that =
this are only the initial issuing authority/authorities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>About the second part; namespace:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>Things like 'Specimen' or 'Experiment'. In contrast =
with the first part, problems with this part are interesting for the =
whole lifescience community because applications will want to use this =
to decide whether the data can be used for a specific application. =
Standardisation of namespaces is necessary. I think it should be =
devided in two parts (not currently present in LSID) like MIME type =
image/jpeg etc: 'observation/abcd' or 'specimen/darwincore' for =
example. If we look at the Donalds PPT we see that in model 1: LSID =
assigned centrally, the namespace is chosen centrally and by model2: =
LSID assigned by each provider, the provider is free to choose one. =
Even language variations of naming a namespace can already give =
problems, so this is why I strongly favor a central mechanism here for =
assigning LSIDs, unless the provider is somehow forced to use a certain =
namespace class. The potential bottleneck problem is not really an =
issue I think (see also DNS mechanisms). If we choose central mechanism =
the issuing authority will always be GBIF (or do we need different =
authorities for different parts of Life Science?) so no problems with =
that also in this case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The third part; object id: no problems there.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The last part; revision id: whether you need it =
depends: do you give the physical objects a GUID or the data records? =
With the first choice you do not need a revision number because the =
physical object will not change (or do they with living collections?). =
At first I thought that a GUID should be put on physical object: if you =
are looking for data, you are looking for data about a certain physical =
object, the source of the data is not (very) important. The same data =
elements in different sources about the same object should be equal, =
else there are errors. Donald's PPT gives the example that someone =
wants to refer to a LSID in a publication as a source. In that case you =
want to refer to a data source with a certain version. Then you need to =
give a GUID to the data and also you need revisions. Data is not =
persistent, it changes all the time. Giving a persistent identifier to =
it is very difficult and not many data systems have full revisions =
support. If a GUID for a 'physical object' is chosen, a thing like a =
species name or author name or country should not get a GUID. These are =
more a kind of attributes: most data will use one or more species names =
as 'metadata'. There needs to be central datasource for each of these =
'metadata', like a NameBank for species names (with its own ID). I am =
not sure whether LSID was designed for a GUID to data or to physical =
objects. The use of namespace and object id instead of databasename and =
recordid seems to indicate that it was designed for physical objects, =
but why then the optional revision id? Instead of a revision id you can =
also assign a new GUID with every change, but then how to point to a =
new version from an old version of data (if you have the GUID of the =
old version, how to get the GUID of the new one).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Requirements in Donald's PPT:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>-if a GUID is on a physical object, the GUID must =
not refer uniquely to a single data element, it must only be unique =
itself. It is also not a requirement in LSID specification. There will =

one IDs. For instance a researcher can have its own ID and also belong =
to the ID of the Institute he is working for. The data for overlapping =

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hello everyone,

Sorry to come into this late - and forgive me if I'm covering trodden
ground here, I just re-joined the list and may have missed a few posts.

I've been looking at various GUID systems for SEEK - primarily the Handle
System underlying DOI, and LSIDs.  It looks like I'll be giving an
introduction to GUIDs and focusing on LSIDs at TDWG in New Zealand in two
weeks.  Judging by the conversation here, I think I'll be keeping my
introduction brief to allow maximal time for discussion!

There are a few things about LSIDs that I want to point out.   First....
as someone has mentioned, some of my early ramblings on GUIDs can be found
here:

http://cvs.ecoinformatics.org/cvs/cvsweb.cgi/seek/projects/taxon/docs/guid/

Some of these files got munged in CVS, but I've fixed them.  These files
are over six months old, and between then and now I've become more of an
LSID fan.  So, if you do bother reading that stuff, realize it's old and
outdated and incomplete in too many places.  I'm going to write a revised
document encompassing and expanding all of that and I'll post here when
it's completed.

Now for some miscellaneous points about LSIDs

* What happens when an LSID Authority goes away?

As I think Dave V. and others have pointed out, when an LSID is resolved,
DNS is used to find the LSID authority.  The LSID authority then provides
information about how the LSID can be served up (e.g. HTTP, SOAP, FTP),
and where to get the data behind  the LSID and associated metadata.  If I
start serving up LSIDs with the authority learningsite.com and later
decide that I'm sick of serving up LSIDs, somebody else can take over
serving up the data and the metadata.  However, I (or they) still bear the
 responsibility of running the authority which points to the data. If my
lsids have an authority like lsid.learningsite.com
(urn:lsid:lsid.learningsite.com:foo:bar) then someone else can take over
the authority by taking over lsid.learningsite.com and I can  still have
www.learningsite.com, mail.learningsite.com, etc... for myself. So, with a
little planning, it's not so hard to deal with an authority going away as
long as the people running it are responsible.

* data and metadata

With LSIDs there's a big difference between the data and metadata of an
LSID - and I think this is going to be the biggest challenge in deciding
how to use them in our context.  What's the data?  What's the metadata?
With gene sequences, the datum is the sequence, the metadata are things
like contact information, who did the sequencing, taxonomic information
about the thing sequenced, etc.  There's an LTER site using LSIDs for
their data sets.  The LSID data is the data set itself, and the metadata
is what you'd expect - a description of the data set, who the
investigators were, that sort of thing.  NCBI has pubmed LSIDs - they're
not serving up the articles yet, but there's associated metadata in there.
 For these things the division between data and metadata is fairly clear.
However, what is the data for taxa?  What is the metadata?

Here's another interesting thing about data and metadata in LSIDs.  When
you issue an LSID you're promising the the DATA behind that LSID never
changes.  Additionally, there's only one authority ultimately responsible
for pointing to the  data, and that never changes (although as above,
someone else can take the authority over).  However, for metadata, there
are no such promises.  Metadata can change.  Furthermore, organizations
other than the authority can provide metadata, as long as the authority
agrees to it and adds them to a list of authorized metadata providers.  I
dont know if this is such a great idea, but its in the specification.

So, what's the data?  What's the metadata?  This question applies to any
GUID system, really - the Handle System has the same issues, but less
clearly defined.  As an aside - the Handle System is very robust and the
fee schedule is probably circumventable.  However, I think LSIDs are
better suited to the direction biodiversity informatics is taking - using
XML-based standards and standard internet protocols to share data.

* client stack versus authority server

The LSID folks provide two batches of code - an authority server, for
people who want to to serve up LSIDs themselves, and an LSID Client stack
- which can be used by organizations to provide access to their LSIDs
and/or proxy LSIDs provided by other organizations.  It may make sense for
an organization like GBIF to build a service using the Client Stack to
support both their own LSIDs and those served by other organizations.  The
Client Stack has a caching mechanism which supports expiration information
from the primary authority, so the primary authority can update where the
LSID may be resolved and metadata of that authority.

In this model, GBIF, or someone else, could support both their own LSIDs,
and the LSIDs of others.  Furthermore, it could choose which authorities
it was going to resolve, so people who wanted to be sure to get "just the
good stuff" according to GBIF could use the GBIF service.  In addition, it
could perform the de-duplication service that several people have
mentioned - trying to maintain a one LSID per data item mapping.

* lsid namespaces and file formats

I don't think the namespace part of the LSID
(urn:lsid:authority:namespace:object:version) is intended to be
semantically loaded except for the relevant lsid authority.  There is a
way in the metadata to state what format the data comes in.  It's not the
traditional text/javascript mime-type tag - instead the format is another
LSID!  For example the FASTA protein sequence file format is:
urn:lsid:i3c.org:formats:fasta.  Clients that understand LSIDs, like the
Launchpad application, can be set to attach applications to LSID formats
so that clicking on an LSID with a given format opens up an appropriate
application.

Sorry to be so scattershot - it's hard to come into the middle of a huge
topic like this.  Im glad to see all this discussion  its going to make
working on my talk much easier (I think)

Wholeheartedly agree on all counts!!!  That's why I still see it as a "soft"
ID (even with enforcement of unique registered Institution Codes, and
enforced uniqueness of CollectionCode+CatalogNumber within a single
InstitutionCode).  It's a stop-gap to solve some of the problems, until a
real GUID system is up, running, and broadly adopted.

As to uniqueness, I think that's (part of) the point of using a URL, instead
of just an institution name or abbreviation.  URLs seem to be effectively
unique.  As to the confusion about "issuing_authority" vs.
"current_authority", count me among the befuddled.  My interpretation of
Dave Vieglais' posts were that the "Authority" URL was assumed to be the URL
where the GUID is resolved to the data it represents.  But Bob Morris' posts
suggest otherwise ("The authority name is the /issuing/ authority. It's an
authority for the LSID, not for its resolution or the underlying data.").
Perhaps I misunderstood Dave's post?  My primary concern about LSIDs is that
(I thought) the URL used for the "authority" portion of the LSID must be
live, online, active, and perpetual in order to resolve the data.  If this
is not the case, (i.e., if, as Bob says, it is only intended to indicate the
*issuer*, not the current authority), then my concerns about LSIDs are
greatly reduced.

> The problems with authority are important for the involved
> authorities only,

Agreed!!  And further, the authority makes sense for "local" or "owned" data
(e.g., specimens, and attributes thereof), but not for "public" data (e.g.,
taxa, and attributes thereof).

Agreed for sure on the last sentence!  And if I interpret the penultimate
sentence correctly, then full agreement there as well.  I had started
writing a response to Bob Morris' post last night, but it got too late so I
didn't finish it.  It included the following:

I'm not particularly enamored by MACs or hex strings over other forms of
unique identifiers, but I WOULD like to see a protocol for bioinformatics
LSID generation that decreased the possibility of duplicate <ObjectID>
portions of the LSIDs from different issuers to effectively zero.  Maybe
there is no meaningful technical reason to do this -- but I can't help but
feel that if LSIDs are later determined not to be ideal for bioinformatics
purposes, it may prove to be DAMN useful that the <ObjectID> portion alone
serves effectively as its own gUid (emphasis on "U" intentional), even
stripped of the remaining LSID components.
***************************************************

Wouter: Is this what you meant by using a unique number?

I also agree with Wouter (in response to Kevin Richards' concern about
single-server bottleneck) that this should not be a concern.  I seriously
doubt that the sum total of all Life Sciences data calls would ever even
approach the level of calls that Google receives.  True, there will likely
not be the same sort of money backing a life sciences GUID system that is
behind Google's server farm -- but even still, given the fundamental
importance such a system would have to such a wide variety of people
receiving such a large chunk of grant money, I can certainly imagine
justifying money on the order of 6 or 7 figures ($/euro) for such a server
system, and I imagine that would be ample money by today's technological
benchmarks (or, more likely, the benchmark a few more cycles of Moore's Law
hence, which is probably when a system of this sort would start to receive
really high volume requests) to get a system capable of meeting the demand.
I think the real bottlenecks are sociological (i.e., getting these damned
fickle life science practitioners to agree on anything), not technological.

Agreed!  Another excerpt from my attempted reply to Bob Morris:

I disagree -- as I stated before, I strongly feel that the number should be
applied to the physical *object* (or virtual representation thereof -- such
as an original description), not the electronic data record.  If Bishop
Museum sends a specimen to Smithsonian, the specimen now curated at
Smithsonian is not, to my mind, a synonym of its earlier life at Bishop
Museum.  Nor is its data.  Both the specimen, and its associated data,
should be considered as fixed into perpetuity.  As more and more data are
transferred from the physical to an electronic form, those data should be
associated to the same GUID for the object -- not multiple versions of the
electronic representation of data related to that object.  If the ID *must*
be tied to the data record, instead of the object, then I take back
everything I said earlier about versioning.  In the data-centric scenario,
versioning becomes absolutely *vital*.  Personally, I think trying to manage
GUIDs as record identifiers, rather than object identifiers, would introduce
unnecessary and excessive complexity.  Biologists are interested in the
objects. The data records are just a convenient mechanism of information
conveyance -- not important entities unto themselves.  This may not apply to
all aspects of Life Sciences, but I think it should apply to objects we're
discussing here (specimens, taxa, references, etc.).
***************************************************

> With the first choice you do

> do they with living collections?).

Living collections do change, and so to unvochered observations, and so do
records representing populations (rather than specific physical organisms).
And even preserved specimens change over time (tracking condition,
preservation status, etc.).  But I think the GUID should be fixed to
physical object, and that whatever dynamic properties of that object are
worth recording over time should be associated back to the physical object.

Where things get more complicated is how to define the "object".  To some
collections, the unit of "Object" may be multi-taxon/multi-specimen (e.g.,
fossil), or single-taxon/multi-specimen (e.g., lot), or
single-taxon/single-specimen (individual specimen), or
single-taxon/partial-specimen (a part of a specimen, like a skeleton vs. a
skin). Single "objects" of any of these sorts may be fractioned (e.g.,
Isotypes, or simply splitting up a multi-specimen lot to send out to
different institutions).  So, one important question in such cases is
whether one of the "child" objects retains the GUID of the "parent" object,
and new GUIDs are assigned only to the remaining "child" objects (the way
Linnaean taxonomy works for taxonomic concepts, and the way most
institutions deal with catalog numbers for specimens).  Or, do *all* child
objects receive new GUIDs, each referring back to an historical "parent"
object that no longer exists?  The temptation is to support the latter, but
in this case, what of a specimen that partial deteriorates and a portion of
it is destroyed, rather than sent to a different institution?  Logically,
the remaining specimen should be treated no differently than it would have
if the deteriorated portion was instead sent to a different institution,
rather than destroyed, and hence receive a new GUID.  But that's starting to
sound an awful lot like condition monitoring.  Perhaps this distinction
should be left to the discretion of the GUID issuer/Object owner on a
case-by-case basis? (Yikes! Inconsistency!) Or, perhaps this is where
versioning comes in (where the versions are actual object versions, not
electronic data versions)?  This seems like a more complicated problem than
the ones we have been discussing so far.

> If a GUID for a 'physical object' is

> should not get a GUID.

I disagree.  For species names, the GUID would apply to the name's original
description/creation event. Metadata for such never change -- they can only
be corrected.  For author names, I would argue that the object to which the
GUID is applied should be thought of as the *name* of the author as a
virtual physical object; not the author as a physical object.  Multiple
AuthorName objects could be linked to each other via an Alias scheme, and/or
tied to a common "Person" (which could either be a separate GUID namespace,
or be defined as a set of linked AuthorName objects).  In the context of
biological objects, place descriptors of all sorts are really just
surrogates to defined two(three?)-dimentional physical spaces. The GUIDs for
such should primarily be established for the physical space, not the name or
other descriptors applied to that space.  The GEOnet Names Server (GNS;
http://earth-info.nima.mil/gns/html/index.html) seems to me to be a useful
model to follow.  They have two ID numbers for each record.  One is the
"Unique Feature Identifier" (UFI): "A number which uniquely identifies the
feature [=place].", and the other is the "Unique Name Identifier" (UNI): "A
number which uniquely identifies a name.".

The point is, these representations to which I think GUIDs should be applied
are effectively permanent/persistent.

O.K., that clears up things a great deal -- but also reinfornces my concerns
about LSIDs for specimen data.  What happens when Bishop Museum sends a
specimen (or an entire collection -- but not all of the collections) to
Smithsonian? If Bishop Museum still maintained lsid.bishopmuseum.org for its
other collections, then the specimen would presumably need a new LSID based
on lsid.Smithsonian.gov.  Is there a protocol for a request coming into
lsid.bishopmuseum.org to be automatically re-routed to lsid.Smithsonian.gov
for just those specimens flagged as transferred?  If so, then I would feel
(slightly) more comfortable with LSIDs if the issuing organizations would
agree to use some sort of independently unique value for <ObjectID>, that
that portion would be preserved along with the specimen object.

Of course, there is also the problem I alluded to earlier, where a specimen
object with a GUID is fractioned and in need of new IDs - but this is a
general problem which will need to be dealt with no matter the GUID scheme
that is adopted.

VERY difficult question.  I perceive taxa (names & concepts) as artificial
constructs, without unambiguosly objective reality; and as such, everything
(except the UID itself) is metadata.  However, original descriptions of
taxon names do have an (almost) unambiguosly objective reality, as do
documented statements about taxonomic concepts to which those statements
apply.  But even still, most of the attributes we might think of data
elements for objects like an original description of a taxcon name, could
also be interpreted as metadata.

What about typographical/transcriptional errors?  Can they be corrected?

Does the expiration apply to the domain, or to the individual object?  In
other words, can a defined set of ObjectID's within one domain's LSID pool
be re-directed, without having to redirect all calls to that LSID domain?

Thanks again for your very useful insights!

I've long thought that parts of the DNS system would be extremely useful to
emulate in some aspects of bioinformatics data management (particularly
taxonomic names; see below).

There could be a useful analog for this in bioinformatics (particularly in
terms of individual institutions serving as regional registries for specimen
UIDs, or IC_N Commissions serving as "regional" registries for taxon name
UID assignment) -- but there doesn't necessarily have to be.

To emulate this in bioinformatics, the "hierarchy" would be achieved simply
by allowing block-assignment of UIDs to various players -- but the important
point here is that only *one* organization ensures uniqueness (in the case
of Internet, of ISPs).  The data to which those UIDs apply would be, for the
most part, the responsibility of the UID recipient, not the UID issuer (in
my world view). Thus: centralized issuance; delegated application.

This is analogous in many ways to how I would envision a global taxonomic
name service.  UIDs are assigned by a centralized body (e.g., GBIF; or by
the IC_N Commissions) to individual names.  Analogous to multiple redundant
Domain Name Servers (DNS) would be Taxon Name Servers (TNS).  Rather than
administered by one organization (e.g., GBIF, ITIS, Species 2000, uBio,
etc.) these TSNs would be replicated on dozens or hundreds of servers all
over the world, and maintained as synchronized within some reasonable time
unit.  Changes to any one replicate would be automatically propagated to all
replicates (either chaotically, or more strictly through one or a few
defined "hubs").  Instead of Domain names as surrogates for IP addresses,
there would be fully qualified "Basionyms" (e.g.,
"OriginalGenusName.OriginalSpeciesName.OriginalAuthor.DescriptionYear.Page.O
therOriginalCitationDetailsAsNeeded") representations of the
less-human-friendly GUIDs (analogues to IP addresses).  Ideally, this system
wouldn't be limited to just taxonomic names, but extended to all taxonomic
concepts, so that the "Domain Name" analogue would be extended to something
like:

"OriginalGenusName.OriginalSpeciesName.OriginalAuthor.DescriptionYear.Page.O
therOriginalCitationDetailsAsNeeded_AppliedGenusName.AppliedSpeciesSpelling.
ConceptAuthor.ConceptYear.Page.OtherConceptCitationDetailsAsNeeded"

Excellent synopsis, and (in my opinion), and excellent model to follow for
at least taxonomic names/concepts data.  Perhaps also for specimen data (but
seems less intuitive for that.) This comes back to my earlier question about
whether it is vital that all bioinformatics GUIDs be of the same scheme; or
whether different schemes might be optimal for different classes of objects.

[For me, the bottom line---which however I nowhere state below---is:
There is /so much/ existing free infrastructure source code---e.g.
http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/lsid/--- and (apparently)
funding, and (manifestly) professionally designed specifications for
LSID concerns that I am horrified at the prospect of adopting anything
else if LSID comes even close to being what the community needs. Or,
let's forget about LSID and instead of deploying what satisfies 98% of
the needs in six months, we could roll our own and deploy what satisfies
80% of the needs in a few years...

To my mind, the only question is this: is LSID good enough? So: first
make the requirements. Then examine existing solutions. Arguing by
analogy can lead to the "hammer" solution, usually attributed to Mark
Twain: When all you own is a hammer, every problem begins to look like a
nail. (Can someone give me an actual /reference/ to that quote????]

-------------------------

The idea of modeling taxonomic uuids on the internet has been around for
about 10 years, and has been written about explicitly for at least 3-4
by Hannu Saarenma and probably others. See his article in
http://reports.eea.eu.int/technical_report_2001_70/en/Technical%20Report%2070%20web.pdf

The Tree of Life http://www.tolweb.org is a defacto such model, though
without name authorities or persistence.

The design goals of TCP/IP and DNS, and their implementation, intersect
the requirements of Bio UUIDs only in a very small set, in fact, deep
down perhaps not at all.

These protocols and the associated address syntax were designed
primarily for /routing/, not in any way designed to guarantee that a
datum twice received has any connection between the two occurrences.

IP addresses are in no way persistent.

IP addresses are not globally unique, albeit in several small and varied
ways:

- The "private address blocks" 10.X.Y.Z, 172.16.0-0-172.31.255.255, and
  192.168.X.Y may be assigned to any machine your and my network
administrator care to, as long as neither is served on "the Internet",
nor have an duplication on "an internet".

-every machine implementing IP, besides whatever other addresses it may
have, is always known to itself as 127.0.0.1;

- the addresses in some IP address ranges are reserved to designate
/many/ machines (multicast IP)).

In general the design of the IP "nomenclature"---i.e. the IP
addresses---is designed to solve routing problems, not identification
problems.  IP address syntax is intentionally not "semantically opaque",
contrary to a requirement (well, a "should be")  of LSIDs and well it
should be. See Section 8 of http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-05-01

[If you don't see why IP addressing is not semantically opaque, try this
exercise: With a single machine instruction (on most machines) how can
you determine whether or not an IP address is in the Class B  private
address space(the 172 stuff above)? Sysadmin's, C programmers, and their
families and employees are not eligible for this competition]

In turn, DNS protocols are designed only to aid discovery of IP
addresses. DNS addresses are also far from persistent (in fact, DNS
records held anywhere have a "Time To Live" field which must be counted
down until expiration, at which time the holder must acquire a new
instance of the assignment of an IP address to a domain name.).

Ah, this is accurate mainly for IPv6, which is much less chaotic than
IPv4 (most of the current Internet) and in turn from the nearly formless
void that was IPv2. But again, ultimate "licensees" do not get
persistent IP addresses. In the US, virtually all dialup users get a
different IP every time they connect, and most home broadband users only
accidently keep their IP addresses, and only if they don't disconnect
very long from the network.

It's well worth comparing the design goals of IPv6 as articulated in
http://www.apnic.net/docs/policy/ipv6-address-policy.html
with those of LSID as articulated in Section 8 of the Draft Final
Specification http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-05-01

In fact, if the UUIDs are meant to be semantically opaque it matters not
one whit who or how these matters are settled. Exceptions to that are
social, not technical. ("If you don't let me decide X, I am not going to
use your scheme". "OK, then you won't participate in its benefits.
That's fine with me")

If you want to see another example of lack of semantic opacity, read the
ISBN standard ISO/TC 46/SC 9 N 326. Part of certain ISBNs can help you
determine an allegedly common publishing-germaine attribute of the US,
Zimbabwe, Puerto Rico, Ireland, Swaziland, part of Canada, and a few
other "regions".

But this is mainly to distribute costs and speed issuance. It has
nothing to do with the naming scheme. The number of organizations to be
issued Bio GUIDs surely is several orders of magnitude less than those
to be issued IBv6 addresses. So I doubt any IPv6 issuance mechanisms are
instructive, at least in their purpose (and hence, if well implemented,
in their implementation).

Not exactly. There is one scheme in case your application can't resolve
it in a more nearly "local" facility. There are /lots/ of ways to find
an IP address from a domain name. All those which comply fully with the
DNS protocol, however, can make available two pieces of metadata: the
TTL of the record it is offering, and the IP address of a machine at
which you can find an authoritative record of the assignment of the dns
name to the IP address. This protocol /might/, but you hope on
performance grounds usually /doesn't/, lead you up as far as the root
servers, and the "one scheme to bind them all". If there is any lesson
here at all, it is that name resolution protocols matter, but resolution
implementations don't. Yet another attribute on which, DNS/IP and LSID
are not distinguishable.

Not quite. Normally, the registrant tells the registrar who has agreed
to be the servers. The other case sometimes happens with "retailers" who
are selling individuals domain names and ISP services at the same time.

These redundant Domain Name Servers synchronize with each other at

More often, only when the TTLs expire, there being no motivation to do
otherwise.

Not usually. The primary and secondary name servers would normally only
cache tdwg.org permanently. They might /acquire/ a record for
www.tdwg.org in response to a request, but they would not in general
renew it after it expired and maybe not even keep it that long. To do so
would be hideously unscalable. If I put 10,000 machines in my domain, my
primary and secondary would be mighty unhappy if they had to keep them
all cached.

No reading I can make of http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/2004-05-01
is consistent with the explanation offered below. "Authority" is not
used at all in Section 9, "LSID Resolution Service". Instead, resolution
is defined to be accomplished by a set of interfaces all of which take
only a full (semantically opaque!!!! Sec. 8, p. 7!!!) LSID as argument.
The interfaces correspond to methods offered by an LSID Resolution
Service. Nowhere in Section 9 is there any relationship mentioned
between resolution and the "authority identification" that is part of
the syntax of an LSID. That is discussed in Section 8, "LSID Syntax"
which carries the sentences (bottom of p. 7) that I have previously
cited: "The authority identification is usually an Internet domain name.
In this case it is recommended that it be owned by the organization that
assigns an LSID in question".

There are too many ">"s for me to understand who is claiming the stuff
below, but whoever it is could do me a favor by telling me which part of
the spec they are reading. (Or if they found a later document at OMG).
Well, OK, I haven't yet read the "Accompanied Files" listed in Appendix
A., some of which are normative and take precedence over the main
document. Maybe the explanation comes from one of them.

I can certainly understand that perspective, and that's one of the main
reasons I am still semi-supportive of the LSID approach (i.e., existing
code). My major concern has to do with the "Authority"/"Resolver" domain
portion of the LSID, and the need (or non-need) for it to be an active,
accessible domain in order to resolve the LSID. I'm also VERY concerned
about there ever being a temptation to change an ID for an object (e.g., a
specimen given from one Museum to another) -- unless it is understood that
the non-"ObjectID" portion is really thought of as metadata of sorts, and
ObjectID itself is globally unique by itself. I'll need to read the LSID
spec in more detail, and give it some more thought, before I comment further
on this.

If that were really the balance, then it would be a no-brainer.  My concern
would be adopting (effectively committing to) a scheme that satisfies 80% of
the needs in six months, instead of being patient and picking a system that
accomodates 98% of the need a few years from now.  If I had confidence that
we could implement LSIDs in a "test-drive" mode for a couple of years,
without being fully committed to them, I'd be much more comfortable.  But as
someone who spends a considerable amount of time trying to undo the damage
of "legacy" solutions to data problems that were hastily conceived, I'm
trying to be cautious.

I don't think anyone (in this thread) was suggesting actually *USING* TCP/IP
and DNS for BioGUIDs (at least I wasn't).  Rather, I was looking to it as a
source of ground-truthed schemes for reliably managing globally distributed
information.  For instance, would DNS synchronization/propagation serve as a
useful model for gobally distributed, synchronized taxonomic registries? Or
would the taxonomic registry work more effectively with one or a few
centralized "masters" with which a larger set of replicates kept
synchronized?  I also think, as I explained earlier, that the hierarchical
approach with centralized block ID issuance and local application might be
instructive to a bioscheme.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by "semantically opaque"? I think I
understand -- but the last thing this thread needs is ambiguity about the
meaning of terms (i.e., "opaque semantics"....  :-)  )

...and as I said before, the real challenge in establishing universally
adopted BioGUIDs is not going to be technical; it's going to be
social/political.

So are you saying that, because BioGUID traffic will be orders of magnitude
smaller than internet domain traffic, there does not need to be delegation
to decentralized authorities?  If so, then we are in full agreement.

This seems to be a fundamental point of confusion (for me anyway).  Are the
domain names embedded within LSIDs information-bearing in the sense that
they are necessarily the internet domain at which the LSID is resolved?  I
guess I should read and understand Section 13.3 of the LSID spec before
commenting further.

O.K., there's a great analogy that may be useful if implementing a
distributed system of synchronized/mirrored biological data servers:  should
they remain in synch at fixed time intervals? In real time with each data
transaction? Or, should some sort of TTL feature be incorporated in data?

Much to think about.  But time for me to get some work done....

I've been watching these messages but have not yet had time to respond to
all of the valuable discussion.

One thing I would note in relation to Richard's comments below (and would
suggest makes a lot of sense) is that we could adopt a model by which each
provider is responsible for resolving the identifiers for their own data,
but that we have a central fall-back server (e.g. one based on a central
data index) to which all requests get forwarded whenever a provider finds it
cannot resolve an id that it originally issued.  This could solve the
problem in a reasonably standard and simple way for cases in which specimens
and associated data do get moved.

One other thing that was probably not clear in my originally sending out a
PowerPoint presentation without a covering commentary was that I think we
need a community discussion not only about the merits of centralized or
decentralized approaches but also about the most appropriate owner of any
core central infrastructure.  I put GBIF in this position in my slides, but
I could equally see this as something which could be done in the name of
TDWG.

I think we just need to be clear that there are on the one hand the BioGUIDs
themselves and how they are created/assigned and on the other hand is the
method to find them later by someone else.  On the Internet there are IP
addresses and how they are assigned (albeit potentially dynamically) and the
method for someone else to find them.  Rarely do you get Internet references
given as an IP address (http://157.140.2.10) (certainly one reason is that
they can be dynamic) but rather as URLs (http://www.tdwg.org) that are then
resolved through the domain resolution process.

This approach enables the two things (number and name) to be managed
separately, yet linked together.

Don't we need the same two mechanisms for BioGUIDs?  Does the LSID spec
address both parts of this?  I guess I had better get over there and read
the whole thing.

Regarding:
>>IP addresses are in no way persistent.
>>IP addresses are not globally unique. [But they are unique on the
Internet]

Making analogies is tough because the details of the example can get in the
way, as in this case.  IP addresses have several attributes.  The point is
not whether IP addresses are analogous to BioGUIDs on the attributes of
static/changeable or universality.  The point is that the IP is analagous
because it is a cryptic non-intelligible and unique number used to locate
another network device by a machine that starts out with no idea where it
is.  That's the analogy - that IP and BioGUIDs are unique, nonintelligible
(ie. semantically opaque) strings of characters/numbers.

The issue is how in the world to you find the BioGUID you are trying to get
to?  Do you just use the nonintelligible string?  Or do we want somewhat
intelligible names as pointers to the nonintelligible?

Regarding:
>>The number of organizations to be issued Bio GUIDs surely is several
orders of magnitude less than those to be issued IPv6 addresses.

True.  But, there are potentially billions of BioGUIDs to be created, which
could exceed the number of IPv6 addresses.  Some institutions would be the
equivalent of a large Internet Registry managing millions of BioGUIDs.

This seems like a big issue to me.  Would GBIF/TDWG or whomever issue
millions/billions of BioGUIDs directly to institution records and not
decentralize by assigning blocks of BioGUIDs to institutions?

Also, when there are billions of something, efficiency becomes an issue.  IP
addresses follow a binary number approach that leads to efficient
processing.  Is there an efficiency issue lurking ahead for the BioGUID?

Regarding:
>>...name resolution protocols matter, but resolution implementations
don't...
This is true when you have working resolution implementations as the
Internet does.  But does LSID have a working resolution implementation now?
If not, creating a new one that works is not that simple I think.  That
would be a good reason for piggy-backing on the existing and working
Internet DNS/domain name resolution system as I've heard mentioned.

-------------------------

The idea of modeling taxonomic uuids on the internet has been around for
about 10 years, and has been written about explicitly for at least 3-4 by
Hannu Saarenma and probably others. See his article in
http://reports.eea.eu.int/technical_report_2001_70/en/Technical%20Report%207
0%20web.pdf

The Tree of Life http://www.tolweb.org is a defacto such model, though
without name authorities or persistence.

The design goals of TCP/IP and DNS, and their implementation, intersect the
requirements of Bio UUIDs only in a very small set, in fact, deep down
perhaps not at all.

These protocols and the associated address syntax were designed primarily
for /routing/, not in any way designed to guarantee that a datum twice
received has any connection between the two occurrences.

IP addresses are in no way persistent.

IP addresses are not globally unique, albeit in several small and varied
ways:

- The "private address blocks" 10.X.Y.Z, 172.16.0-0-172.31.255.255, and
  192.168.X.Y may be assigned to any machine your and my network
administrator care to, as long as neither is served on "the Internet", nor
have an duplication on "an internet".

-every machine implementing IP, besides whatever other addresses it may
have, is always known to itself as 127.0.0.1;

- the addresses in some IP address ranges are reserved to designate /many/
machines (multicast IP)).

In general the design of the IP "nomenclature"---i.e. the IP addresses---is
designed to solve routing problems, not identification problems.  IP address
syntax is intentionally not "semantically opaque", contrary to a requirement
(well, a "should be")  of LSIDs and well it should be. See Section 8 of
http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-05-01

[If you don't see why IP addressing is not semantically opaque, try this
exercise: With a single machine instruction (on most machines) how can you
determine whether or not an IP address is in the Class B  private address
space(the 172 stuff above)? Sysadmin's, C programmers, and their families
and employees are not eligible for this competition]

In turn, DNS protocols are designed only to aid discovery of IP addresses.
DNS addresses are also far from persistent (in fact, DNS records held
anywhere have a "Time To Live" field which must be counted down until
expiration, at which time the holder must acquire a new instance of the
assignment of an IP address to a domain name.).

Ah, this is accurate mainly for IPv6, which is much less chaotic than IPv4
(most of the current Internet) and in turn from the nearly formless void
that was IPv2. But again, ultimate "licensees" do not get persistent IP
addresses. In the US, virtually all dialup users get a different IP every
time they connect, and most home broadband users only accidently keep their
IP addresses, and only if they don't disconnect very long from the network.

It's well worth comparing the design goals of IPv6 as articulated in
http://www.apnic.net/docs/policy/ipv6-address-policy.html
with those of LSID as articulated in Section 8 of the Draft Final
Specification http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?dtc/04-05-01

In fact, if the UUIDs are meant to be semantically opaque it matters not one
whit who or how these matters are settled. Exceptions to that are social,
not technical. ("If you don't let me decide X, I am not going to use your
scheme". "OK, then you won't participate in its benefits. That's fine with
me")

If you want to see another example of lack of semantic opacity, read the
ISBN standard ISO/TC 46/SC 9 N 326. Part of certain ISBNs can help you
determine an allegedly common publishing-germaine attribute of the US,
Zimbabwe, Puerto Rico, Ireland, Swaziland, part of Canada, and a few other
"regions".

But this is mainly to distribute costs and speed issuance. It has nothing to
do with the naming scheme. The number of organizations to be issued Bio
GUIDs surely is several orders of magnitude less than those to be issued
IBv6 addresses. So I doubt any IPv6 issuance mechanisms are instructive, at
least in their purpose (and hence, if well implemented, in their
implementation).

The International ISBN Organization http://www.isbn-international.org/

Not exactly. There is one scheme in case your application can't resolve it
in a more nearly "local" facility. There are /lots/ of ways to find an IP
address from a domain name. All those which comply fully with the DNS
protocol, however, can make available two pieces of metadata: the TTL of the
record it is offering, and the IP address of a machine at which you can find
an authoritative record of the assignment of the dns name to the IP address.
This protocol /might/, but you hope on performance grounds usually
/doesn't/, lead you up as far as the root servers, and the "one scheme to
bind them all". If there is any lesson here at all, it is that name
resolution protocols matter, but resolution implementations don't. Yet
another attribute on which, DNS/IP and LSID are not distinguishable.

Not quite. Normally, the registrant tells the registrar who has agreed to be
the servers. The other case sometimes happens with "retailers" who are
selling individuals domain names and ISP services at the same time.

These redundant Domain Name Servers synchronize with each other at

More often, only when the TTLs expire, there being no motivation to do
otherwise.

Not usually. The primary and secondary name servers would normally only
cache tdwg.org permanently. They might /acquire/ a record for www.tdwg.org
in response to a request, but they would not in general renew it after it
expired and maybe not even keep it that long. To do so would be hideously
unscalable. If I put 10,000 machines in my domain, my primary and secondary
would be mighty unhappy if they had to keep them all cached.

Agreed. Yet one more attribute where IP/DNS and LSID are not

<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ...exactly the way that I envision an =
organization like GBIF would be </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; charged with the task of issuing UIDs for =
certain biological objects.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;There are Regional, National and Local =
Internet Registries that </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;subdivide</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;&quot;license&quot; IP addresses to ISPs, =
who in turn license IP addresses to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; organizations.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Ah, this is accurate mainly for IPv6, which is much =
less chaotic than IPv4 (most of the current Internet) and in turn from =
the nearly formless void that was IPv2. But again, ultimate =
&quot;licensees&quot; do not get persistent IP addresses. In the US, =
virtually all dialup users get a different IP every time they connect, =
and most home broadband users only accidently keep their IP addresses, =
and only if they don't disconnect very long from the =
network.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>It's well worth comparing the design goals of IPv6 as =
articulated in <A =
HREF=3D"http://www.apnic.net/docs/policy/ipv6-address-policy.html" =
TARGET=3D"_blank">http://www.apnic.net/docs/policy/ipv6-address-policy.h=

</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; There could be a useful analog for this in =
bioinformatics </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (particularly in terms of individual =
institutions serving as regional </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; registries for specimen UIDs, or IC_N =
Commissions serving as </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;regional&quot; registries for taxon name =
UID assignment) -- but there </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; doesn't necessarily have to be.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>In fact, if the UUIDs are meant to be semantically =
opaque it matters not one whit who or how these matters are settled. =
Exceptions to that are social, not technical. (&quot;If you don't let =
me decide X, I am not going to use your scheme&quot;. &quot;OK, then =
you won't participate in its benefits. That's fine with =
me&quot;)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>If you want to see another example of lack of =
semantic opacity, read the ISBN standard ISO/TC 46/SC 9 N 326. Part of =
certain ISBNs can help you determine an allegedly common =
publishing-germaine attribute of the US, Zimbabwe, Puerto Rico, =
Ireland, Swaziland, part of Canada, and a few other =
&quot;regions&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;So, there is a heirarchy of how the =
&quot;unique identifiers&quot; are managed.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; There is</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;in fact a central authority, but it =
delegates to decentralized</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; authorities.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>But this is mainly to distribute costs and speed =
issuance. It has nothing to do with the naming scheme. The number of =
organizations to be issued Bio GUIDs surely is several orders of =
magnitude less than those to be issued IBv6 addresses. So I doubt any =
IPv6 issuance mechanisms are instructive, at least in their purpose =
(and hence, if well implemented, in their implementation).</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; To emulate this in bioinformatics, the =
&quot;hierarchy&quot; would be achieved </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; simply by allowing block-assignment of UIDs to =
various players -- but </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the important point here is that only *one* =
organization ensures </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; uniqueness (in the case of Internet, of =
ISPs).&nbsp; The data to which </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; those UIDs apply would be, for the most part, =
the responsibility of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the UID recipient, not the UID issuer (in my =
world view). Thus: </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; centralized issuance; delegated =
application.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;Is there an analogy for BioGUIDs to have a =
central body who divvies </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;out</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;unique numbers (like IP addresses) to =
decentralized bodies or large</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; organizations?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>The International ISBN Organization <A =
HREF=3D"http://www.isbn-international.org/" =
TARGET=3D"_blank">http://www.isbn-international.org/</A></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>is roughly the IPv6 model.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; GBIF seems to me to be the principle =
contender.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>I enthusiastically agree. Also the /principal/ =
contender. [Sorry, couldn't resist. My fingers slip on that one =
sometimes too.]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;Since IP addresses are hard to memorize (and =
so too would be a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;BioGUID),</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;domain names&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;are used. Starting with a domain name, you =
can first find the name </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;and/or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; IP address</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;of a device, called the Domain Name Server, =
that can locate the IP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;address</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; of other</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;computers.&nbsp; This is a form of indirect =
addressing.&nbsp; ICANN also manages </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; top-level</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;namespace for the Internet. They decide what =
the valid domain </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;&quot;extensions&quot;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; are (like</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;.com, .uk) so that everybody, everywhere =
knows where to look them up.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Then, the domain</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;name extensions are separated among the =
Regional, National, and Local</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Interent Registries</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;around the world.&nbsp; There is a scheme =
for where to find the IP </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;addresses</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; for every domain</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;extension (e.g. .com is on the ARIN =
registry, .com.uk is on the ).</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Not exactly. There is one scheme in case your =
application can't resolve it in a more nearly &quot;local&quot; =
facility. There are /lots/ of ways to find an IP address from a domain =
name. All those which comply fully with the DNS protocol, however, can =
make available two pieces of metadata: the TTL of the record it is =
offering, and the IP address of a machine at which you can find an =
authoritative record of the assignment of the dns name to the IP =
address. This protocol /might/, but you hope on performance grounds =
usually /doesn't/, lead you up as far as the root servers, and the =
&quot;one scheme to bind them all&quot;. If there is any lesson here at =
all, it is that name resolution protocols matter, but resolution =
implementations don't. Yet another attribute on which, DNS/IP and LSID =
are not distinguishable.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;Then there is a layer of Domain Registrars =
who have been accredited by</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; ICANN to assign</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;domain names for the domain extensions - =
e.g. tdwg.org.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;The domain name registrars are told by the =
owner of the domain where </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; find their particular</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;Domain Name Servers which may be many to =
enable redundancy - Primary,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Secondary, Tertiary,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;etc.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Not quite. Normally, the registrant tells the =
registrar who has agreed to be the servers. The other case sometimes =
happens with &quot;retailers&quot; who are selling individuals domain =
names and ISP services at the same time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>These redundant Domain Name Servers synchronize with =
each other at</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; particular times</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;of day and may be located all around the =
world.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>More often, only when the TTLs expire, there being no =
motivation to do otherwise.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;They are the main</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; &quot;switchboard&quot; for a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;particular organizations computer names and =
associated IP addresses. </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;Then the individual organization can create =
multiple computers for the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; domain name - e.g.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;www.tdwg.org - and add them to the Domain =
Name Server listing.&nbsp; There </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; be many computers</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;for a domain, for instance: info.tdwg.org, =
www2.tdwg.org, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;myname.tdwg.org.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Each of these</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;can be a different computer with a different =
IP address.&nbsp; The </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;redundant</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Domain Name Servers</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;all contain the list of all these names and =
what IP addresses they </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;&gt;are.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>Not usually. The primary and secondary name servers =
would normally only cache tdwg.org permanently. They might /acquire/ a =
record for www.tdwg.org in response to a request, but they would not in =
general renew it after it expired and maybe not even keep it that long. =
To do so would be hideously unscalable. If I put 10,000 machines in my =
domain, my primary and secondary would be mighty unhappy if they had to =
keep them all cached.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; This is analogous in many ways to how I would =
envision a global </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; taxonomic name service.&nbsp; UIDs are assigned =
by a centralized body </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; (e.g., GBIF; or by the IC_N Commissions) to =
individual names.&nbsp; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Analogous to multiple redundant Domain Name =
Servers (DNS) would be </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; Taxon Name Servers (TNS).&nbsp; Rather than =
administered by one </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; organization (e.g., GBIF, ITIS, Species 2000, =
uBio,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; etc.) these TSNs would be replicated on dozens =
or hundreds of servers all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; over the world, and maintained as synchronized =
within some reasonable time</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; unit.&nbsp; Changes to any one replicate would =
be automatically propagated to all</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; replicates (either chaotically, or more =
strictly through one or a few</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; defined &quot;hubs&quot;).&nbsp; Instead of =
Domain names as surrogates for IP addresses,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; there would be fully qualified =

representations of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; less-human-friendly GUIDs (analogues to IP =
addresses).&nbsp; Ideally, this system</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; wouldn't be limited to just taxonomic names, =
but extended to all taxonomic</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3D2>&gt; concepts, so that the &quot;Domain Name&quot; =

Too many streams to choose from so I will jump in here as well.
Bob's comments on wiki vs. mail are well noted.

One really important attribute of LSID's is that they *are* intended to
be persistent enough to outlive the objects that they represent and/or
our ability to resolve them. So that, one day, we might know when
multiple documents have referenced a single object - digital or
otherwise.  It is this property that is particularly useful to GBIF
where there is a requirement to identify the unique objects duplicated
within a system that is designed, from the outset, to replicate at all
costs. But as Dave V. has earlier noted - we may still be confusing our
need for LSIDs with our GUID requirement.  Digir and Biocase already
provide mechanisms for index maintenance, meta-data query, data
retrieval etc. =20

The LSID specification, noted by Thau below, states that as well as
being persistent an LSID will always resolve to the *"same set of
bytes"* [concrete] or an *empty set* [abstract] ( I have assumed that
this meant *exactly the same*, but I could be wrong).  The implication
is that DiGIR, ABCD and HISPID representations of the same object all
require unique LSIDs . The specification documents provide examples to
illustrate *hierarchical* ways of registering LSIDs for a single object
in multiple formats.  Versioning is in there to cover changes to an
object - which must still be registered - but a change in format could
require yet another LSID.

Each LSID references a static object - once one has one ...  unless one
has more than one, which is also possible.

never-the-less there are still other ways in which LSIDs may prove
useful to biodiversity informatics. Dave V. has mentioned the possible
use of an LSID that resolves to a DiGIR query - a static object that may
be used to retrieve from a dynamic data set.  And Thau has mentioned the
fact that while the object behind an LSID must not change, meta-data for
that object may be provided from many sources and in different formats.
Perhaps there is scope here for the the object behind an LSID to be only
that relatively stable component of the contributor data set that will
be used to build the global index (or query), with LSID registration and
resolution used to simplify index maintenance and with the getMetaData
methods providing access to complete records or their access points.=20
Duplicate records registered with abstract LSIDs resolving to a parent
LSID...

In herbaria the physical objects are commonly duplicated. Supposedly
duplicate vouchers from a single collecting event -  the primary data
source.  Is our aim to provide access to the data gathered during that
event (with the benefit of taxonomic hind-sight) or to the objects that
result, or both?  How do identify replicate material? Will an LSID help
with resolution of ambiguous events?

I agree on the multiple catalogue numbers, but I believe still
multiple database records of specimens will exists. Since I myself am
not involved in collection curation, but in evaluating the
information therein (specifically we work on organism interactions)
we have a database of now close to 200 000 fungal host parasite
records. Some express opinion without further citation, others
express opinion backed up by voucher specimen that contains all the
information that would be found in collection databases. GBIF seems
to have no place for such data so far - and it would be difficult to
provide, since we usually have none of
"InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber" (which is
different from the problem having duplicate CatalogNumbers you
discuss). Still what kind of data is that? What kind of data is
created if a PH.D. student digitizes the specimen records used for a
taxonomic revision in a database that is specific to that revision?

Bottomline: The physical specimen does exist, but in the foreseeable
future all data GUIDs will be attached to data, not to the specimen.
The exceptions is only where indeed it is possible to attach the GUID
to the specimen, then this could be cited.

But then we have descriptions, and for description concepts
(characters, structures, states, modifiers, etc.) we also need GUIDs
to allow federating descriptions that use a common terminology. We
have discussed this in SDD on and off (specifically we are proposing
to prefer semantically neutral identifiers, and propose a simple
optional mechanism called debugid/debugref to enrich data with
calculated, semantically meaningful identifiers to facilitate
debugging) - but at the moment SDD really waits for a more general
and common solution.

So this discussion is highly relevant to descriptions as well. My
main point is: what we are really interested in GBIF in the end is
knowledge, not physical possession. If we limit our thinking of the
GBIF system to the very special case of institutionalized collections
(as both DwC and ABCD in my opinion currently do), or names governed
by a nomenclatural code, I believe we may later have to rearchitect.

BTW, partly for these differences between institutional collection-
customs and knowledge publication customs, I vote against a strongly
central system. LSID authority (lsid.gbif.net) and namespace (with no
or low semantics) should be managed by GBIF, but not the
ids/versions. GBIF may provide a service to generate them, but should
accept any locally generated ID and trust the generator to manage
uniqueness.

Duplicate specimens occur because the collector collected multiple samples
of the same organism and sent them to other institutions.  The duplicate
specimens themselves probably have different CatalogNumbers in each
institution.  The specimen database records reflect the actual specimens.
Therefore, the specimen database records when combined from multiple
institutions have duplicates of the same organism.  But, only by looking at
either the Collector and Collector's number or date/location can the
duplication be recognized.

One key use of GBIF-merged specimen records is to count or plot the number
of organisms in an area.  When a wide net is thrown around the globe, the
duplicate records are caught and return overstated counts.  Ideally a GUID
would identify a single unique organism record and enable duplicates to be
identified, but I can see no easy way for that to occur within LSID.

There is some discussion of how this might happen with LSID in
http://efgblade.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/BDEI/AbstractEntities

Yes, but I guess a central question, which Donald included in his PowerPoint
file, is whether the GUID is assigned to the physical object, or to the
electronic representation (data record).  Most of my comments have been from
the standpoint that the GUID applies to the physical specimen. If it is the
electronic records that we wish to uniquely identify, then it seems to me
that the <objectID> component of an LSID should apply to the physical
specimen, and multiple database records should be uniquely identified using
the <version> component.

This is part of the reason why I think that the
"[InstitutionCode]+[CollectionCode]+[CatalogNumber]" solution is only a
temporary one.  This raises another question: would the GUIDs be limited to
just vouchered specimens? Or, would they also be assigned to unvouchered
specimens (e.g., field observations of specific individual organisms, that
were not vouchered in a Museum collection).  Or, would unvouchered
"biological instances" represent a different class of GUIDs?

The simple answer is to make observations a different class of object.  But
in my data management world, I need to deal with everything from sight
records with little more data than a taxonomic determination; to specific
observations involving specific (uncollected) individual organisms
(sometimes with as much associated data as any vouchered specimen); to
collected organisms that were brought into a lab, examined by experts, but
not added to a permanent collection; to stereotypical museum voucher
specimens; to specimens that were added to the permanent voucher collection,
but later lost or destroyed.  In my mind, there is little fundamental
difference between the two endpoints of this spectrum, and I have thus
decided to treat all such entities as the same class of object ("Biological
Instances") -- which also spans the [population-->multiple specimen-->single
specimen-->specimen part] continuum.  It's not a perfectly clean solution;
but no solution is perfectly clean, and to my mind, this is the optimal
solution from a data management perspective.

I would say that the student would (ideally) reference existing specimen
GUIDs in his/her specific database -- not create new GUIDs (unless
referencing physical specimens -- vouchered or not -- that have not yet
received GUIDs, in which case new GUIDs would be assigned using the
appropriate procedure, whatever that ends up being).

Good point!  My concern, though, would be that we might end up in the same
state of chaos that we are now, where multiple electronic records of a
particular physical specimen are not rigorously cross-linked, and thus run
the risk of being counted as multiple/separate physical instances.
Identifying the physical object with the <objectID> component of an LSID,
and different electronic representations of the associated data as different
<versions> of the same <objectID> could represent a way to deal with both
"realities".

Are you talking about GUIDs for character definitions, or GUIDs for
instances of character definitions applied to individual specimens/taxa, or
both?  I see character definitions as analogous to taxon concepts; names
used to represent those character definitions as analogous to taxon names;
and the application of those character definitions to specific specimens (or
taxa) as analogous to taxonomic determinations (i.e., the application of
taxon names/concepts to specimens).

Agreed!! (Especially considering the forum on which this discussion is
taking place.) This is part of the reason why I keep mixing taxon
names/concepts examples among specimen examples. In the back of my mind, I
was thinking SDD examples as well, though I think I failed to express that
adequately.

I generally agree.  My leanings towards centralization revolved around GUID
generation only (not application of GUID to associated data -- which is what
I would define as the "management" part), and *perhaps* GUID resolution (but
more for "unowned" sorts of data like taxonomy, and only in the paradigm
that each GUID could be resolved by one and only one domain server, and that
the GUID would cease to have meaning if/when the branded domain server
ceased to exist).

Whether or not GUID generation happens centrally or in a distributed way
seems to me to depend on what GUID scheme is ultimately adopted.

Because I don't really like to use Wiki's I am going to continue this
thread here.  There are some useful examples abstract and "real"
instantiations of LSID 's at:
http://www.i3c.org/wgr/ta/resources/lsid/docs/LSIDqueriesAndResponses.txt

Here is a relevant section:

IsAbstractOf Query:
LSIDs may name abstract concepts suchs as "rat myoglobin" as well as
concrete instantiations of those concepts such as "rat myoglobin in FASTA
format".  This query is used to find all of the LSIDs naming concrete
instantiations of a particular LSID that refers to an abstract
concept.  In english, the query string below literaly reads: "Fill in the
blank, 1AFT is an abstract concept of _________?"  Another way to think
about it is, "What concrete instantiations of the abstract concept '1AFT'
exist?" The response includes the LSIDs of the 1AFT data in four different
formats.

Query string:

Browsing http://www.i3c.org/ and
http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/lsid/ will generally provide you
with examples similar to all of our issues.  Somewhere in all those
articles there must be examples of how to recognize the identify of a
sequence that has been deposited in two different sequence databases.  Lots
of good reading for the long plane trip to NZ.

I think this is not practical. Do you mean those GLOPP organism-
interaction-data that have specimen voucher information can not be
published/referenced in GBIF until I figure out whether a collection
has digitized them (most have never digitized elsewhere!)? Or if I
find they have not been, when the collection starts to digitize them,
they would have to create for those that have already been published
in GLOPP use a new version of the GLOPP LSID?

The same applies to taxonomic data - most revisions contain voucher
data.

I believe there are three situations:

1. A collector has created what is classically called a specimen
duplicate, i.e. material has been collected in multiple or a single
collection has been split (including propagation of living
material/Cultures). These may be in the possession of a single or
different collection. In most cases it will be very important to know
about their close relationship, but also identify them separately
(esp. in dead cryptogams or any living culture there is no guarantee
that the assumption about conspecificity of the collector is actually
true!).

2. A single specimen has multiple conventional accession number in a
single collection, because over time the collection used different
numbering schemes (stamping, then barcoding, perhaps RFID in the
future). This was what I thought was meant with "duplicate
CatalogNumbers", and I think it is the only one where full identity
exist, so a single GUID with repeated AccessionNumber field is best.

3. A single specimen has been digitized mutliple times - esp. not
only in a curatorial database, but in analytical datasets created for
data evaluation (like host-parasite studies, taxonomic revisions,
etc.). Here the physical specimen is identical, but GUIDs need to be
available to identify the distinct data.

I think I agree. But regarding the current discussion, I think the
most important point is NOT to burden LSID with any semantics that
allows to conclude which kind of decision a data provider has taken.
The namespace part of LSID should NOT be interpreted as a
standardized class-of-objects.
The GLOPP data have a continuum of specimen data where at least I
know the institution, those where a know a physical voucher exists,
but I have no clue where, those where I don't know whether material
has been preserved, and those where I know it is a pure observation.
So my decision would be similar to yours. However, some museums may
want to act different.

Since the latter case is the default case (unless everything changes,
the money will allow only digitization of a tiny fragment of
collections in the coming decades): If that is done by the student -
how would the collection when it finally comes to digitize the
specimen itself learn about the "physical GUID" of a specimen?

I think the solution is in data, not in GUIDs. If the collection has
barcodes or RFIDs, include them in the data. Also make sure that
collections (Institutions) and subcollections have GUIDs (perhaps
derived from Index herbariorum). This solves the counting problem
without imposing a system of requirements that in my opinion are non-
managable.

(Not sure, I think they are the same: the definition is identified by
a GUID, the instance references that GUID, and the GUID of a class
(taxon) or object (specimen), which in itself is a unique
combination. Assigning a GUID to the cross of two GUIDs seems
superfluous.)

I agree; a minor point of difference being that there is no
equivalent to nomenclatural codes and that the "taxon names" are
expressable in any number of languages. Which is why SDD uses IDs
only for the character concepts, not for the names. The combination
of character-concept ID, language-ISO-code and audience code (pupil,
student, expert, farmer, etc) is an ID to the "character name".

Not necessarily.  I don't think the issue is whether or not the collection
has been digitized, but rather whether GUIDs have already been assigned to
the vouchers you want to document in the GLOPP dataset. So, if your question
is more along the lines of "do I need to check to see if GUIDs have already
been issued to voucher specimens that I cite, before I issue new GUIDs",
then my answer -- in the long run, at least -- would be, "well....yes!"
That's sort of the fundamental point of the GUIDs, isn't it?  But I don't
see this as being necessarily burdensome. For example, if your GLOPP dataset
included unambiguous pointers to specific voucher specimens (e.g., via
InstitutionCode+CollectionCode+CatalogNumber), then it *should* be a
relatively quick and straightforward process to find out if GUIDs have
already been assigned (if it's not quick & easy, then the GUID service would
be horribly inadequate!)  If, on the other hand, the GLOPP dataset does not
provide unambiguous pointers to specific voucher specimens, then the
"vouchered" aspect of those specimen citations seems unsupported, in which
case your GUIDs would need to be assigned to virtual/unvouchered "specimens"
(analogous to observation records), and hence non-duplicate.

I would hope that if you assigned GUIDs to GLOPP-relevant voucher specimens
that belong to a collection that is not-yet digitized, you would do the
courtesy of providing the manager of that collection with a listing of the
GUIDs you created for the specific relevant specimens. I would further hope
that, when that collection is eventually digitized, the manager would have
the wherewithal to assign new GUIDs only to those specimens that did not yet
have them.

But, as someone who has worked in a natural history collection for nearly
two decades (and who bore witness to the transition of the collection from
non-digitized to digitized), I certainly do understand the "realities" of
this, and fully recognize that my optimistic perspective is likely to be
overly idealistic.  This is why I feel that duplicate assignment of GUIDs is
inevitable (that is, two different numbers for one object; not duplicate
GUIDs), and MUST be accommodated in any GUID system that is developed.  My
main point is that such "redundant" GUID issuance should be minimized (i.e.,
never done intentionally), and quickly/easily identified as such whenever it
is discovered.

So....if/when the situation does come up that (for example) GLOPP assigns
GUIDs to vouchers on behalf of a non-digitized collection, and that
collection later (inadvertently) re-assigns redundant GUIDs to the same set
of specimens; that eventual discovery of this duplication should be
accommodated by a mechanism for "retiring" one of the IDs into "objective
synonomy" of the other ID, and automated systems should be implemented in
the resolver service that "auto-forward" the retired ID to the active ID.

If your question is more about whether the collection, when it later becomes
digitized, should use the same <objectID> ID as was assigned for the GLOPP
dataset, but qualify that same Object ID with a unique version number --
then my answer is, "I don't know".  That is sort of the question I was
trying to ask ('though I didn't ask it very effectively). Basically, I was
suggesting that/asking whether it would make sense to pin the <ObjectID>
portion of a GUID to the physical object, and using the <version> feature as
a unique identifier to electronic representations thereof?

> The same applies to taxonomic data - most revisions contain voucher
> data.

Same solution, I think.

For the most part, though -- I see these as "growing pains" of a GUID system
during its first years of existence.  I would predict that two decades from
now, if one were to do an analysis of redundant GUIDs, one would find the
bulk of those having been issued relatively early on.

I think this is the problem. No single record in our database has
this information, and to my knowledge, most if not all of the
physical specimen sheets referred to do not yet have a unique
catalogue number. Adding truly unique catalogue numbers physically to
specimens (as opposed to often non-unique batch accession numbers)
has often not been made and is now done either during digitization,
or it may in recent year also happen during loan processing.

However, most of the printed literature cites collection name (which
may be historic, if collections are merged), taxon name, plus one of:
 - simply the information that it is a type (often expressed by
exclamation mark after collection acronym, indicating that a type has
been studied)
 - for non-types 2-4 elements out of: collector, collection date,
collectors field number and location. Having collector plus
collectors field number is relatively good (although uniqueness is up
to the collector, some assign batch numbers for collection events),
but again in my experience it is relatively rarely cited. None of the
GLOPP records taken from literature cited a field number. The other
fields are normally sufficiently unique if you go into the collection
and see what is there, but is a terrible key to try any matching
against a data service - at least the location is usually comparable
by automatic string matching.

As said, if you go into the collection, it is easy to identify them.
If you know that a fragment of the collection is completely digitized
- as opposed to random digitization which only digitizes specimens
recently loaned - you can manually identify it on the computer. I
would guess every specimen identification takes at most 5 minutes and
involves one or several queries and picking from the result list
manually.

I believe most biologists will consider the specimen citations used
in print until now a voucher - I do not agree with the blank
statement that this is something else. It is usually unambiguous -
but not very good for machine processing. Contradictions?

The problem is: what would the collection manager make with such a
list? It would be the problem in reverse: the list of GUIDs is not
easy to connect to the physical specimens. Most collections where
specimens can be handled attach unique numbers to the specimens
during digitization (but perhaps even this is not true in some insect
collections, where handling the specimen creates the danger of
destroying it). The list delivered by GLOPP would contain information
about specimens that have no such barcode/etc. number yet.

Certainly not intentionally, but is should be clear that a museum
should not start to prohibit the use of laptops when a Ph.D.
candidate comes in and "digitizes" some specimens for a taxonomic
revision. If the museum system supports it, it is wise to ask to use
the museum system, but if the system is too complex and requires long
training, rather have the monography than nothing...

I think you could rather view this as an optional deduplication
layer. Your specification explicitly contradicts at least the LSID
specifiction to retrieve repeatedly exactly the same data. If an
analysis of GLOPP is based on some data - e.g. a misidentified host
plant - and cites this, it should be recoverable. Being silently
forwarded to different information only causes confusion.

So I prefer a view where GUIDs refer to data objects. I still do not
see, how you propose to attach them to the physical objects for those
researchers working in the collection itself. A secondary service can
then know about relationships of multiple data objects referring to
the same physical object. This service may be able to find cross-
references in the data itself, have smart methods to estimate
uniqueness based even on location strings, or may have manually
create cross-reference tables.

An important point is that different "deduplication" scenarios exist.
For example, in culture collection, many strains are cross-preserved
in multiple collections. So "CBS 123.88" may be "equal" to "ATCC
1234132" or "BBA 77123". Ideally we may even know the history: "BBA
77123" > "CBS 123.88" > "ATCC 1234132". However, the chance that any
of these strains (which are like "versions") has been mixed up (or
mutations occurred) is always there. Thus, if I look for duplication
of the collection event data, I want to deduplicate. If I want to
check a confusing DNA sequence, I may want to know about other
derived strains, but I absolutely need to know exactly which strain
from which collections was sequenced.

I agree, but I probably think it is more relevant than you seem to
think. I believe the "early days" to last the next 50 years - the
time needed until collections are fully digitized *plus* the time it
takes to make publication without citing GUIDs inacceptable.

I guess my point was, if the GLOPP database does not contain enough
information to uniquely identify a given voucher specimen (whether it is a
catalog number, or some combination of other data), then the GLOPP data
record can't really be considered "vouchered", can it?  Maybe I am not
thinking hard enough about this, but it seems to me that without the ability
to re-locate a cited specimen with a fair degree of certainty, then the
record would need to be considered "unvouchered".  So, if enough information
is available to pinpoint the specimen, then it *should* (and I emphasize
this word only because I know there will undoubtedly be exceptions) be
possible to associate the GUID with the voucher specimen at a later time.
If there is not enough information to re-locate the specimen, then it seems
to me that the connection with the specimen is broken, and the record
becomes a stand-alone "unvouchered" biological instance.

O.K., I think I understand now, that a human could likely re-locate the
specimen based on some assemblage of data, but that this assemblage of data
would certainly require a human to establish the connection.

I guess my feeling is this:  We should always do our best to avoid the
assignment of duplicate GUIDs to a single "biological instance" (of the
physical kind), but we should also acknowledge that inadvertent duplication
will be inevitable (as it may well be in the scenario you describe), and
therefore build-in a system for accommodating "objective GUID synonymies".

I imagine it will depend, on a case-by-case-basis, whether the cost of
manual match-up of this sort at the time a GUID is to be assigned exceeds
the cost of risking duplicate GUID assignment.

No contradictions from me. But the concept of "voucher" to me becomes more
ambiguous as time goes by.  I have thought a lot about how one might pool
"evidence" from Museum collections, published data, in-situ images (still-ph
otos and video), unpublished sighting reports, etc., and there is no easy
answer that I have found.  My conceptual approach has been to reduce all of
these to reported instances of a particular organism at a particular place
and time. This is what I have meant by "biological instance". Where they
differ is merely in how well-documented they are (unpublished word-of-mouth,
published word-of-mouth, film or electronic image, tissue sample, preserved
organism, etc.), and to what extent they can be re-examined by later
researchers (in my mind, the distinction between "vouchered" and
"unvouchered").  Some uncollected sight records (e.g., rare plants in
Hawaii) have a high degree of re-examination potential, whereas some
specimens collected and preserved in a Museum, but misplaced, lost, or
deteriorated, have a very low degree of re-examination potential.  In-situ
images, though they may have limited documentation (external appearance
only, from one angle only in the case of still photos, limited in resolution
at which the image was captured), have a very high degree of re-examination
potential.

The point (to me, at least) is that in all cases there was some physical
"biological instance", and it is that entity to which I think the GUID
should be assigned.  If a published report cites a specimen preserved in a
Museum, then the same GUID should be used for both the Museum specimen, and
the published citation thereof. If a published report cites an organism that
was never collected or preserved in a Museum, and the publication itself
constitutes the only record of that biological instance, then a new GUID
should be assigned to it.  When a record of the latter sort is later
discovered to be in reference to a specimen that exists in a museum that
already has its own GUID, then those two GUIDs should be branded as
"synonyms".

Agreed. But I would think the student should provide a listing of all GUIDs
assigned to specimens within a collection, including as much information as
is necessary to uniquely identify each GUID-assigned specimen.  Whether the
collection manager ever uses that information or not is a different
question, but I think a "culture of respect" for avoiding duplicate GUID
assignment should be integral to the whole GUID process.

I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean by "optional" (i.e., at
whose option), but I think it should be a fundamental component to any
resolution service.

> specifiction to retrieve repeatedly exactly the same data.

Yes, I know -- which is why I'm feeling less cozy about LSIDs.  I think the
crux of the issue centers on the question that Donald asked in one of his
PowerPoint slides:  Are these numbers assigned to the physical or
"conceptual" (=non-electronic "virtual") objects, or are they assigned to
the electronic/digital representations thereof?  My feeling, from the point
of view of a taxonomist who develops databases for natural history
collections, is that the ultimate goal (i.e., seamless transmission and
exchange of biodiversity-relevant data) will be better served if:

1) The ID's are assigned to the non-electronic (physical or conceptual)
objects;

2) "Static" data associated with those objects be allowed to be changed (as
errors are discovered and corrected) without altering the GUID (and that
data history logs for these static data attributes be thought of as a
secondary function of the data management, not affecting GUIDs);

3) "Dynamic" data associated with those objects (e.g., multiple taxonomic
identifications of a specimen) should be handled "robustly" (i.e., not as
"versions" of the complete set of data associated with a particular
specimen)

I'm not sure I understand the question.  I guess I would answer with another
question:  How does a Social Security Number (SSN) for a U.S. Citizen (NINO
in the UK, SIN in Canada, INSEE in France, TFN in Australia, etc. -- see
http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Social%20Security%20number) get
attached to an individual person?  I don't think anyone would think of a SSN
as an identifier for a data object -- it is a unique identifier for the
physical person.  I believe that commonly used physical objects in biology
(specimens, taxon names/concepts, references, agents, character definitions,
etc.) should have equivalents of SSNs assigned to them, for the same reasons
that U.S. Citizens have SSNs (i.e., to provide an unambiguously unique
identifier useful for managing information associated with a physical
person).

Obviously, SSNs are not the perfect model for BioGUIDs (for a number of
reasons), but the point is that they represent an ID attached to a physical
entity.

This sounds to me like an unnecessary layer of complexity.  But I remain
open-minded on this issue.

I'll have to think about this some more, but it comes back to the question
of what "unit" a GUID is assigned to.  This is not so much a problem for
taxonomic objects; a little bit of a problem for Reference objects, and a
potentially HUGE problem for specimen/"biological instance" objects.  Again
this raises the question: How important is it to use the same GUID scheme
for all of these different classes of bio-objects?

I imagine that the vast majority of "publications" in science 50 years from
now will be electronic.  But I see your point -- even if it's only 20 years
as I suggested, that's still a lot of headaches to deal with.

Richard's points about unifying to observations are very good and
relevant to use. Indeed reexamination possibilities are not 100%
dependent on collection versus observation-only data. The
reexamination of a film or still picture is somewhat intermediate
between the reexamination of field notes and of an actual specimen.
Certain questions can be asked, others not. However, the main point
is that these are properties of the observation and that more cases
exist than museum or not.

I basically disgree about assigning GUIDs to physical objects, if
these are not unambigously attached to the object, rather than to one
of possibly several data records. I have no problem if a barcode or
RFID is a GUID rather than a local ID. I think it is not practical to
demand all museums to change their physical system to a GBIF-chosen
accession numbering system. It certainly would simplify life - I
agree about desirability!

Yes, but the association problem is solved here - and NOT by
unreliable secondary data. You can ask a person to show you the
government-produced SSN-card, which is at least somewhat difficult to
falsify. If you can do the same with a physical specimen object - no
problem. If you cannot, and have to "guess" the GUID by maiden name
and last known address, SSN would be in trouble.

I understand better your points here, and will consider them carefully this
week.

Regarding assignment of GUIDs to electronic records rather than physical
specimens -- do you feel the same way about taxonomic names?  I'd hate to
have 5-10 ID numbers for every taxon name (e.g., one generated by GBIF, one
generated by ITIS, one generated by Species2000, etc.)  My understanding of
the whole point of BioGUIDs was to get away from this sort of duplication.

Clearly this will be a major point of discussion in New Zealand -- I'm
looking forward to it!

Yes and no. I think the question collapses in the case of
nomenclatural records. I believe the codes should move and endorse
nomenclatural databases to be authoritative for providing
authoritative name records. Since these are data objects, a GUID is
natural to them, and real world (which is abstract in the case of
names anyways) and data world are congruent.

I am more reserved about demands to provide a central registry for
taxon concepts (or "derived/secondary" taxon concepts, if the
nomenclatural act of creating a name itself is considered a taxon
concept as well):

If somebody publishes a description of a taxon in Germany, printed or
digital, perhaps providing a GUID of the nomenclatural data record
the description assigns itself to, perhaps providing a DOI for its
publication - I see no reason to go to a separate database, create a
taxon concept record there, and then cite it back in your own digital
publication. Jessie Kennedy and I differ on this point.

This is just a reminder to those who can make it to the TDWG 2004
meeting in Christchurch, NZ:

After the main meeting, on Saturday 16th, Sunday 17th, and Monday
18th there will be SDD workgroup meeting. The official schedule
(http://www.tdwg.org/2004meet/TDWG_2004_ScheduleOverview.htm) is a
bit confusing in no longer mentioning the Monday that originally
present.

The main topics will be:

1. A discussion of the new Lucid version and what SDD and Lucid can
learn by a detailed comparison

2. A discussion of the CIPRES program and how SDD can serve this
large-scale program by the phylogenetic community.

The meeting is open to participation for all those interested.

My solution to this, which I will describe in more detail in my presentation
at TDWG, is to assign the GUID to every "Name+Reference" instance
("Reference" here defined broadly; not restricted to publications).  A
susbset of these instances will be "name-bearing" instances (i.e., "original
taxonomic descriptions"), recursively serving as the "Name" part of the
Name+Reference instances.  Another (overlapping) susbset of these would be
"concept-bearing" instances.  Still others may simply be specimen
determination labels.  They all represent a documented use of a taxonomic
name by a human (or set of humans).  The idea is that taxonomic names do not
exist outside of a usage context, and that the usage context is usually
objectively discernable and "reusable" (and as such, well-suited for shared
universal GUID assigment).  Keeping it broad and simple like this allows the
same GUID pool to be used for a variety of applications (handles to names
and concepts, for the purposes of constructing nomenclatural synonymies,
mapping concepts, applying names/concepts to specimens, etc.)

Must....get....some....sleep.....

Subject:      Taxonomic Search Engine - web services and LSIDs
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

As a test of various tools for querying multiple taxonomic name
databases I've created a "Taxonomic Search Engine"
(http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/portal/ ) that may be of
interest.

The site will search external databases (currently ITIS, Index
Fungorum, IPNI, and uBio) for a name. If it finds the name, you can
click on the name to get more details, including a link to the
original web site that provided the name.

Some examples to try are "Morus", "Physeter macrocephalus", and "Apus apus".

Behind the scenes the application talks to each database in turn and
outputs the result in a consistent format (or, as consistent as the
very different database outputs will allow).

The search engine also outputs Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for
each name. Followers of recent discussions on "GUIDs" (Globally
Unique Identifiers) for taxonomic names will know that LSIDs are one
candidate for assigning a GUID to a name. The search engine provides
one way to explore the utility of LSIDs (including links to tools for
viewing them).

I'd welcome comments/feedback. Future plans include adding more
databases and improving search performance using caching.

Dear Roderic D. M. Page,

Congratulation for your 'Taxonomic Search Engine' portal.

I maintain a database on tropical crustacea on the Internet (link in my
signature) and I am interested to know if your project could include (or
point to) that particular database?

For example, when I hit 'Calcinus' in your portal I am redirected to
ITIS data. Is it possible also to get the list of species that is
obtained when  'Calcinus' is entered in the field genus of request form
at: http://decapoda.free.fr/search_data.php ?

Sincerely.

The Taxonomic Search Engine I recently developed

GenBank taxonomy, in addition to ITIS, Index Fungorum, uBio, and
IPNI. Although GenBank is not an authoritative source of taxonomic
names, they do have many names not in these other databases.

I try to finish the changes on SDD and UBIF. A major issue in my eyes
is to get a final vote on the question how to go along with the
MultilingualDesignPattern i.e. use Label/Representation or skip the
outer collection container in this case?

I apologize for reopening a question that was already debated a long
time ago, but in the context of finding common ground with other
biodiversity schemata (in UBIF) it seems to be one of the issues
people tend to take up as a case of being to complicated.

Can you comment and vote on:

Those not wanting to use the WIKI can send email back to me and I
will collate their opinion on the WIKI.

Many thanks!

Nice.

It would be great if you exposed this as a Web Service. There seem to be
several  frameworks for doing this with PHP applications.

This is next on the to do list. The site already makes extensive use
of SOAP to talk to two of the source databases, I just need to tidy
up the code a bit in preparation for making it a SOAP server. There
are also performance issues to address, for which caching might help.

Because I can't spell to save myself, I've added a "did you mean"
feature to the Taxonomic Search Engine
(http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/portal/ ). You now have the
option of asking for suggested spellings, based on a list of names I
have stored on the server, as well as any suggestions offered by
Google.

For example, if you search on "Physeter catadon", you will be asked
if you really meant "Physeter catodon" (note the "o" instead of the
"a").

Both the spelling suggestion, and the name search itself are now
available as web services. Documentation and example clients are
available at the site (I hope to flesh these out as time permits).

Rod

Subject:      LSIDs and taxonomic schema - an alternative view
In-Reply-To:  <a0611040abdb9326ad6ff@[130.209.46.63]>

Based on playing with LSIDs as part of the Taxonomic Search Engine
(http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/portal ), and following some
of the recent efforts on developing taxonomic name schema (such as
the LinneanCore), I've become concerned that I don't think the
implications of LSIDs have been fully thought through.

Specifically, I worry that by focusing on schema for names in their
present format, the community is making more work for itself, and
missing the point (and potential) of LSIDs.

Metadata
--------

LSIDs are not simply identifiers, they come with associated metadata.
For example, the LSID
urn:lsid:ipni.org.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:Id:20012729-1 has
associated metadata which can be viewed directly at
http://ipni.org.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk/authority/metadata/?lsid=urn:lsid:ipni.org.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:Id:20012728-1
, or by using a LSID resolver
(http://biopathways.ibm.nebiogrid.org/resolver/urn:lsid:ipni.org.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:20012728-1
).

This metadata is in RDF (Resource Description Format), and provides
information about the name, and links to other resources (via LSIDs).
For example, the above record for *Poissonia heterantha*" has a link
to its basionym, *Tephrosia heterantha*.


We've been here before
-----------------------

It seems to me that there is an assumption that all we do with LSIDs
is stick them in an XML document as an identifier ("GUID"), and our
work is done. I feel this rather misses the point.

The key point is that, if we serve LSIDs we need to serve metadata
about the names. So, we need a standard for the metadata. But, hang
on, we've just spent energy on a standard for our data...? So, once a
schema is agreed, someone then someone has to create a new schema for
the metadata for LSIDs..? And, how do these schema relate...? Hmmmm.

One response to these ideas might be to simply serve a document based
on one of the current schema (such as the LinneanCore) as metadata.
But I think is a poor solution that doesn't exploit the potential of
RDF metadata.

RDF
---

RDF is very cool, in that there are tools that can take RDF and
reason about them. For instance, given metadata for the LSIDs
urn:lsid:ipni.org.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:Id:20012728-1 (Poissonia
heterantha), and urn:lsid:ipni.org.lsid.zoology.gla.ac.uk:Id:944651-1
(Coursetia heterantha), we can infer that these two names are
synonyms, because they share the same basionym.

If we use RDF, we get this kind of ability for "free." There is a lot
of work in the semantic web, onotology, and bioinformatics
communities about making inferences like this. Isn't this the kind of
thing we want to do, rather than simply pass XML documents around?
Wouldn't it be nice to take two or more LSIDs and workout their
relationship, automatically (where possible). Client databases that
stored LSIDs could work out whether names were synonyms in a standard
way, without actually having to be told that the names are synonyms.


A radical view
--------------

Instead of developing schema for exchanging information that are
specific to taxonomy, a radical approach would be to adopt LSIDs as
identifiers and standardise the associated metadata (which would
convey all the information about the name). By adopting RDF we can
tap into a lot of existing work, as well as existing external
standards (e.g., Dublin core, and the emerging use of LSIDs in
bioinformatics). It also offers an opportunity to serve up
information on taxonomic names in a much more useful form than a
simple XML document.

I wonder if an opportunity is being missed here.

Rod

I've put together a very simple extension that enables Mozilla and
Firefox to handle the "lsidres" protocol used in IBM's Launchpad to
resolve LSIDs. The extension redirects the browser to the
http://lsid.biopathways.org LSID resolver. Once the extension is
installed, links such as
lsidres://urn:lsid:ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.lsid.biopathways.org:pubmed:12441807
become clickable.

This is a bit primitive compared to Launchpad, but means that people
who don't use Internet Explorer 6 on Windows can have clickable
LSIDs. The extension has been tested (I use that term loosely) on
Windows 2000, Mac OS X, and Red Hat 8, with Firefox 0.9.2 - 1.0.

This upload is in accordance with the regulations of TDWG which require a =

I very urgently look forward to criticism. However at the moment only sche=

Hi all.

I'm looking for a sample xml-file in ABCD 2.0 format, containing some
taxonomical data. It doesn't have to be large, but should contain some data
I can visually check for consistancy.
I apologise if this isn't the correct forum to make this request, but it was
all I could find. Can someone help me to get such a file, or direct me to
the correct place to ask for this?

Thanks for your time.

At the recent St. Petersburg meeting of the Taxonomic Databases Working

formal TDWG subgroup, the Image Interest Group will discuss what should
be the concerns for biodiversity multimedia standards especially as they
relate to other TDWG standards, where can one find resources about
biodiversity, and other, image acquisition and management, and what
should be the charter of a full subgroup.

Most such discussion should take place on the TDWGImage wiki
http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/TDWGImage, where you are invited
to peruse, comment, register, set an RSS feed or all of the above. You
need to register only if you want to comment or want mail notice of
discussion. (RSS is better!). In addition, you can join a mail
discussion list Tdwg-image@lists.tdwg.org, but the wiki is the preferred
discussion locus. The mailing list will automatically receive notices of
posting in the wiki and will mainly be the focus of transient messages
about topics of interest. To subscribe to the mailing list, visit

For fun I've created a site that searches three data sources - NCBI,
Yahoo images, and Google Scholar for information on a taxonomic name.
If you type in a name you get information on whether that organism has
been sequenced (and if so, how many sequences are available), the first
five images Yahoo finds on the web, and up to 10 documents from Google
Scholar (with DOIs and links to PubMed, where available ).

If you'd like to try it go to http://ispecies.org (you'll get forwarded
to a machine here in Glasgow).

I know there are all sorts of problems with searching on names, but
I've found it to be fun to see just how much information is out there.

Example links to try are:

http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies/?q=Pediculus+humanus
http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies/?q=Rhea+americana

http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies/?q=Agathis+australis
http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies/?q=Banksia+coccinea

Please be aware that the image search can sometime produce images you
might not want children or the faint hearted to see -- despite Yahoo
claiming it filters adult content. You have been warned...

Comments welcome.

Very cool.  Do you have a page on "how it works"?  What would be
needed to add another source?

Dear Julian,

I've put some quick notes up here:
http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies/how.html.

Ideally, if a source provides XML (or something similarly easy to
handle, it can be added). As part of other projects I've been playing
with getting specimen data from DiGIR providers, for example.

Regards

Rod

Dear Gregor,

Various comments:

Relationship to ER
-------------------------

In many ways RDF is very like ER-modelling (e.g., =20
http://bit.csc.lsu.edu/~chen/pdf/Chen_Pioneers.pdf), indeed the W3C =20
states that "RDF is a member of the Entity-Relationship modelling =20
family." One could think of the modelling the link between two entities =20=

as a triple.

There's also a comment on this on Danny Ayers' blog =20
(http://dannyayers.com/2005/03/16/xml-andor-rdf/) - embedded in some =20
other extraneous stuff.

You might also want to look at D2R Map =20
(http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/d2rmap/D2Rmap.htm) for =20
mapping between database schema and RDF.

One way I like to think of this is that I think RDMS are geared towards =20=

locally held data, hence the emphasis on primary keys and =20
normalisation. If, however, much of the data is elsewhere (as I believe =20=

it is in biodiversity informatics) then you need ways to refer to =20
remotely held objects (i.e., URIs, which is another way of saying =20
GUIDs). Hence, instead of locally defined primary keys you start to =20
store GUIDs (which, by definition, are unique). If you then start to =20
think about relationships between the objects identified by GUIDs, then =20=

you've pretty much got RDF. I would also say that in terms of managing =20=

local data, RDBMS are not going away. RDF, in my opinion, only really =20=

becomes relevant once you want to make the data available to others, =20
and once you want to enable people to be able to aggregate that data.

RDMS and triple stores
-------------------------------

Regarding triple stores, most ones that I'm aware of are actually built =20=

on top of a RDBMS. For example, I use 3store, which uses MySQL as the =20=

backend.

Would we be first in line?
----------------------------------
Well, I've been serving RDF for taxonomic names since mid-2005, uBio =20
are serving their own LSIDs, and DiGIR is moving that way. So, there =20
are functioning examples to play with, and people making a start in =20
this area.

Does bioinformatics use it?
------------------------------------

The biggest use I've seen is the port of UniProt to RDF =20
(http://expasy3.isb-sib.ch/~ejain//rdf/) by Eric Bain. The EBI has some =20=

interest in RDF via the BioMoby project. Another project is BioPax (see =20=

commentary at Nodalpoint - =20
http://www.nodalpoint.org/2006/03/12/=20
integrating_biopax_compliant_pathway_data).

GML/SVG not RDFS
--------------------------
(no idea)

Importing RDF
-------------------
Well, this is sort of what triple stores do. Given that RDF is composed =20=

of triples the trivial mapping to a relational database is to store the =20=

triples in one table with three columns (subject, predicate, object). I =20=

guess for most people the issue is getting data out of RDBMS into RDF, =20=

not the other way around.

Tools
-------

As one who positively hates the diagrams XMLSpy produces I'm biased, =20
but when  I played with Altova SemanticWorks I was distinctly =20
underwhelmed.

Hope this helps,

Regards

Rod

Dear Computer Taxonomists,

Greetings, and welcome to the new discussion list...

As an attempt to start a discussion, I am posting this to ask: do we all
really agree that there should be a new standard for descriptive data
based on XML, as a substitute for DELTA (as well as NEXUS and XDF)? Or
should we instead just try to improve one of the existing formats? As of
myself, when I first read the specifications of "XDELTA", I was under
the impression that in some way the DELTA format as we know it would
then become obsolete... But what of NEXUS, or XDF? Has anyone considered
of the integration of these formats plus DELTA into a single new,
XML-based, format for descriptive data?

Just "food for thought"...

Best wishes,

Standardising on something like XML means that custom parsers/parsing
routines can be eliminated, making it much easier to write software
to manipulate the information. I've already run over these issues
in my web page on XDELTA.

:) I didn't mean to imply that, just that using XML would provide a
better underlying data format.

The reason I've been holding fire on additional work is that I believe that
a proper requirements analysis needs to be done to decide what data needs
to be captured by the standard - does DELTA meet all the current
requirements
of taxonomists? Are there other standards (e.g. NEXUS, etc) which are better
suited to some applications/data? Can these be integrated into a single
new standard (or modular standard)?

As a computer scientist rather than a taxonomist I don't feel qualified
to address these issues, as I'm not working with this data on a daily
basis.

Perhaps we should start by building a list of requirements and then
measuring DELTA, NEXUS, etc against them to see whether they meet
them. If they do - then theres no reason for change, if they don't
then it may be time for a new standard. XML is only one possible
'syntax' for such a standard, but its one which has a lot of
software support.

Note that when I refer to DELTA I refer to the data/file format
specifically and not the application software. These should be
evaluated separately.

So, what do people see as the basic requirements for this kind
of format?

- ease of use (i.e. authoring)
- ease of processing (parsing, validating, reading, converting)
- ease of sharing (i.e. distribution)
- open-ness (i.e. proprietary/non-proprietary)
- ease of extensibility (i.e. ability to add more information cleanly at a
later
data)
- internationalization
- un-abiguity of data representation
- unlimited size of data sets? (i.e. any limitation on character names,
lengths, item names, numbers, etc)

What types of data need to be modelled by the format? (this can
be a post-requirements gathering step, but some consideration needs
to be given early on to measure the 'success' of the current
formats)

- what types of characters? (real, integer, text, etc)
- what types of data (text, images, other formats?)

Just some thoughts.

The proposition I think is that (at some level) it is desirable to transfer
data between formats (such as DELTA, NEXUS or LUCID). If this is the case
then there are difficulties that need addressing, specifically the loss of
information that occurs.
To some extent the different formats do deal with different subsets of
'descriptive' information, for example you might argue that characters used
in phylogenetic analysis are defined differently from those used in
identification programs. Nevertheless, there are still areas of overlap
between two or more of the exisiting standards that are not currently
supported by the available import/export routines (eg. character
dependencies to name one).

The approach of amalgamating (what some might regard as) the 'proprietary'
formats into a single 'superstandard' wasn't much favoured since that would
only provide only for exisiting functionality.
What was talked about at the TDWG meeting was to take a step back from
existing standards in order to look at the whole area of descriptive data in
the broadest sense (and for my money that includes marking-up or tagging of
descriptive texts).
As Gregor has already summarised elsewhere, the first step of the discussion
should be a requirement analysis, the second the possible use of XML as a
metaformat.

On the subject of the latter, XDELTA looks to me to be a straight
representation of (a subset of) the DELTA standard in XML. While this does
open up the scope for parsing, it isn't necessarily the approach I was
thinking of.

For example, how could retrieval of descriptive information across a
department or institution be facilitated? Is it because of the sheer
flexibility in how the characters can be defined using DELTA, that querying
across projects is difficult to say the least, unless the character set is
global that is (and therefore with a lot of redundacy)?

Can character definitions be constrained without making too tight a
straight-jacket for oneself? Might it be possible to represent taxon
character descriptors by for example an entity/property/value (eg.
leaf/shape/ovate) based schema?
This on the face of it would seem to map onto an XML element/attribute/value
schema pretty well. Would that help define more closely how we construct
characters and maybe even prove universally applicable for all character
types?

Could one constrain further by expressing within the schema the hierarchical
relationships between the elements(eg 'blade' and 'petiole' as child
elements of leaf') or would the introduction of terminology into the
'standard' be a step too far?

Hello

- The main existing formats, if we count by the number of species
covered,
are not DELTA, or other Computer Taxonomists's inventions, they are the
semi-formal formats of the existing floras in plain text, which contain
the
vast majority of existing species;
- the priority is to put this existing material in XML (this can be done
using standard parsing techniques);
- we can then :
    - make queries using all the power of XPath
    - make all kinds of RDF statements on the species from the outside,
e.g.
an entomologist can, in an buterfly description, or any context,
indicate
that it is a pollinizator for some plant species (see Annex)

These techniques are in the straight line of the World Wide Web
Consortium
Recommandations.
Using such  RDF statements, it is also possible to add sets of
characters à
la DELTA.

So I propose to decouple the description form the specific taxonomic
issues,
such as finding keys applying to specific subsets of species, minimal
sets
of characters, etc. This is good design since no consensus can be
quickly
achieved on taxonomic issues, since researchers want to keep their
freedom.

It seems that what the majority of botanists (and others biologists and
the
humanity in general) needs the most urgently, is a usable World Flora.

Moreover, having reference descriptions available as URI (Uniform
Resource
Identifiers) on the Web, allows different taxonomists researchers to
link
their formal descriptions to a common reference, and to become
interoperable.

See much more details on the Worldwide Botanical Database project at :
http://jmvanel.free.fr

P.S. Can somebody point me to documents on:
XDELTA, NEXUS and XDF

My guess is all of the above?  And XML would provide them too, no?

As far as Delta goes, I think that the data are fairly close to what
taxonomists have been encoding into traditional taxonomic descriptions.=20
'Success' is pretty good.

Nexus can include charater/state data but also other things such as ways
to describe phylogenetic trees in the so-called "New Hampshire" format:=20

  ((raccoon:19.19959,bear:6.80041):0.84600,((sea_lion:11.99700,=20
  seal:12.00300):7.52973,((monkey:100.85930,cat:47.14069):20.59201,=20
  weasel:18.87953):2.09460):3.87382,dog:25.46154);=20

Nexus is actually an extensible format so almost anything could be
included.=20

Unfortunately there is still doesn't seem to be an online description of
Nexus, though the standard was printed in the journal Taxon a couple of
years ago.=20

I sense that application developers who use Nexus are pretty happy with
the format since is was a collaborative effort to begin with, and that the
Nexus community would not see a great benefit in adopting a new data
format.  Anybody else have this impression?=20

I know nothing about XDF.  Mauro once pointed out this reference though:=20

  of biological data sets. Mathl. Comput. Modelling, Vol. 16, No. 6/7,

> - what types of characters? (real, integer, text, etc)

Yep.  Also cyclical data (months, seasons) colors, lengths, shapes -- I'm
afraid this could list could be expanded quite a bit, if you go beyond
primitive types.=20

> - what types of data (text, images, other formats?)

I would suggest that any MIME content-type could potentially be useful,
including video/mpeg, audio/wav, etc.=20

I agree.  XML only solves the syntax problem.  The semantics problem can't
be solved as easily with technology, but would rely either on community
agreement, or on extensive mappings between various ontologies.  I think.

There is value in straightjackets, especially of the schema type.  For
example, one could make a perfectly decent database using a single table
looking like this:=20

<pre>
 +---+------------+-------------+-----+-----------+-------+
 |id | table_name | column_name | row | value     | type  |
 +---+------------+-------------+-----+-----------+-------+
 | 1 | city       | population  | 22  | 2,000,000 | int   |
 +---+------------+-------------+-----+-----------+-------+
 | 2 | city       | name        | 22  | Boston    | char  |
 +---+------------+-------------+-----+-----------+-------+
 | 3 | person     | name        | 34  | Mr. Magoo | char  |
 +---+------------+-------------+-----+-----------+-------+
 | etc...
 +---
</pre>

But by avoiding the straightjacket of a fixed chema, we've made our
queries *really* tough to formulate. I think that this is a classic
tradeoff in any modelling methodology.=20

This would be The Lexicon, no?  It does seem to go beyond the task of
making a file format for data transfer.  But it gets my vote nevertheless.=

Perhaps not even semi-formal?  (I'm reminded of Richard Montague's

still popular in some formal semantic theories.)=20

A bit optimistic?  I think that even defining a context free grammar for
these data and constructing a lexicon will not get around some of the
classic problems of anaphora and ambiguities arising from multiple
quantifiers.  However, I grant that it can probably be done -- somehow
and sort of.  :-)=20

A new W3C recommmendation -- Hurrah!  But not a general enough inference

I'm a big fan of RDF and I've experimented with it myself.  Gregor
Hagedorn also mentioned RDF in the context of XML during the recent TDWG
meeting.  So it's great to see it come up again!  That said, I must also
say that for the purposes of this group, I do have some reservations about
RDF being a technology that is mainstream enough as yet to base a
community effort on.  More likely, the XML community will use XML-Schema
or something else more like relational database technology and less like
predicate logic.=20

> These techniques are in the straight line of the World Wide Web
> Consortium  Recommandations.

Yes, but you have to admit that this is one recommendation that hasn't
been terribly popular.  The recommendation was made in February and has
really not seen much enthusiatic adoption, so I think we should approach
this one with caution.  I say this because, for example:

 - Zero books available (at least from amazon.com) so far.

 - W3C's Timeline: News, Events, and Publications lists nothing since
   March 1999

 - IBM has apparently dropped their RDF Parser

 - Even the current maintainer of the W3C's SiRPAC parser, Sergey Melnik,
   has doubts about RDF saying:

  "RDF 1.0 has a number of legacy, heritage or flawed features, that make
  both the specification and implementation intransparent. To make my
  criticism a bit more constructive, consider as examples the following
  issues:

  "- aboutEachPrefix: if you create an RDF model using RDF/XML that
  contains aboutEachPrefix, and serialize it back, the intended semantics
  is lost, since this aboutEachPrefix is not reflected in the model.

  "- xml:lang does not appear in the model either and is therefore also a
  bug in the specs. Either a new triple has to be appended to the model,
  or xml:lang should be ignored.

  "- there is no principle difference between rdf:ID and rdf:about. There
  would be one if you appended rdf:isDefinedBy to every resource defined
  by rdf:ID. Not in the model - no semantics.

  "-...
=20
  "Before such issues have been resolved, I'd be very careful about
  motivating people to implement something. Currently I am a courtesy
  maintainer of SiRPAC. However, to be frank, I'm not willing to
  rewrite/adapt it as long as the specs are flawed."

Yes.  The attraction for me here is that not only would we not have
to write parsers, we wouldn't have to write inference engines either.
I've been playing around with SiLRI (Simple Logic-based RDF Interpreter)
and I think it's terrific.  However, as I said before, it is not clear
that these kinds of tools will become mainstream.  (I hope they do though)

I pretty much agree with you on all fronts (ask anybody) but I worry that
what you describe could be a massive undertaking and may be beyond the
scope of what we can practically accomplish here.  It would be terrific to
see it done though, especially with RDF.

OK, enough rambling from me -- best to all,

Putting on my programmer hat here, those kinds of things should be about
to be included in whatever XML standards were set up relatively transparent
to the user.  For instance, "leaf" by default would contain certain properties
(size, shape, petiole, base, apex, number, arrangement, location) that
the user could code or mark as non-existant withought having to worry
aout the "parent/child" or other object relationship.  Folk who want to
*write* software that uses the XML (or whatever) standard would be the
ones to worry about those issues.

One of the data types that I would like to see modeled is a "matrix type"
data type.  Consider the leaf shape.  When I made up my DELTA data set,
I turned leaf shape into *3* characters -- one for leaf width, one for
the position of the widest shape, and a 3rd for the contour of the
sides.  (narrow, broad; ovate, obovate; rounded, parallel).  As the
basis for this division, I used the IAPT plain shape chart -- a two
dimensional representation.

When you have a shape that varies from narrowly ovate to broadly obovate --
how can you model that in *one* character?  Variance from narrowly ovate
to narrowly obovate is possible just as variance from narrowly ovate to
narrowly obovate.

You would define the data type by number and size of dimensions.  (Two
would probably be sufficient for most cases).

This came up in several different forms already, but any hierarchy should be
able to be terminated at any level without generating a syntax error.
Semantics
need to be defined based on the depth of the hierarchy in any particular
instance. This will help to accommodate the large body of semi-structured text
descriptions that already exist and were discussed earlier. For example, the
"Leaf" node might be defined to contain a list of optional properties (or
sub-nodes) such as size, shape... but the standard should allow for free text
description as well, perhaps by allowing for a <NaturalLangage> as one of the
options, sort of an "other" category but with definable semantics. So a system
might treat the value of this field as a term vector in a full text retrieval
system or some other application we have not thought of yet.  It could coexist
with the other more restrictive nodes such as <size>. This would allow
partially successful parsers to "automatically" mark-up full text documents to
conform to the standard.

This use of parsers brings up a meta-data issue that came up at the TDWG
conference. Many data elements can have a certainly associated with them.
Certainly is of at least two types. One is the confidence that the data in the
node is actually correct. A good example might be programs that attempt to
register location based on verbal descriptions. This might only matter for
computer programs generating the data and programs reading the data but I can
imagine human uncertainty as well. For example an entomologist might know part
of an insects habitat or range leading to uncertainty in this data.

The second type of uncertainty is the type used in LucID for indicating how
well the characteristic classifies the organism being described for
identification purposes.

One of the things that I did when I was coding up my original DELTA dataset
(since I was wortking from published floras, etc) was to code a text
character at the end of the characters for a given organ (e.g., leaf)
that included the text of the protolog, or whatever textual description
that I was working from .  This wasn't necessarily for searching
or information retrieval; but rather it was to allow me to *later*
come back and verify the data without having to go did the original
source off the shelf.  Lazy woman's option.

Subject:      Whoa!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

By golly what a start! Great stuff!

Having read this morning the small flurry of contributions from Mauro,
Leigh, Don, Jean-Marc and Noel, it's obvious that there are many ideas out
there just waiting to burst forth. Perhaps we need a bit of structure now
(or perhaps later).

I'd suggest that there are several issues that can be used to structure the
discussion.

1. WHAT'S THE INITIAL LIMIT FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO?

We could try to describe the universe that we're operating in by choosing
which of the following is most true.

a) We want an interchange format for current (and future) descriptive
data/identification programs.

These include LucID, DELTA's CONFOR, IntKey etc (the programs), XID,
Linnaeus, and others (we should perhaps fill in this list sometime). The
idea of an interchange format would be simple - each program would continue
to store data in their own native format, but would implement import/export
functions to the common standard so users would not be stuck in one format.
The format should be at least a sum of all the types of data stored by each.

Note that under this model if a user stored data using one program's data
editor (e.g. the DELTA Builder) then exported to another program (e.g. the
LucID Player) there will be data loss (since not all data stored will be
useable by the recipient) and data inadequacy (since the recipient may
support data that can't be stored by the storer). But having an exchange
standard will increase pressure from users on all developers to do some
competitive bootstrapping, and perhaps also encourage someone to develop a
direct builder for the exchange format.

b) We want a new data format for storing, parsing and manipulating
descriptive data, without reference to existing programs.

This would perhaps not differ from a) above, except that it would start more
from scratch. It could perhaps subsume a) if such a format could also be
used as an interchange format. But given the suggestion from Jean-Marc:

>- The main existing formats, if we count by the number of species
>covered,
>are not DELTA, or other Computer Taxonomists's inventions, they are the
>semi-formal formats of the existing floras in plain text, which contain
>the
>vast majority of existing species;
>- the priority is to put this existing material in XML (this can be done
>using standard parsing techniques);

it would perhaps not serve the function of a) and those of us with existing
programs would not advance beyond square 1.

If we go this route a whole new suite of software tools will be needed for
handling this, turnkey systems at the very least to put tools in the hands
of ordinary users who don't know and don't want to know the intricacies of XML.

c) We want to go the Universe and subsume all existing descriptive data
formats into one superformat.

This seems to be behind the comments about subsuming NEXUS. I think we
should tread warily here. My impression is that users of NEXUS are more than
happy with their format, there is no pressure for change coming from there,
and we could merrily try to subsume NEXUS but find that the NEXUS community
would ignore our efforts thankyou very much I'm quite alright. Are the
Maddisons/Swoffords/Donoghues of the world listening? What do you think?

d) any other statements?

2. WHAT ARE THE BASELINE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SYSTEM

I agree completely that step 1 whatever our goal must be a formal
requirements analysis. Perhaps this would best proceed by the group
contributing to an evolving list (or is there a better way?). We could use
Leigh's as a starting point

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REQUIREMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTIVE DATA FORMAT
1. - ease of use (i.e. authoring)
2. - ease of processing (parsing, validating, reading, converting)
3. - ease of sharing (i.e. distribution)
4. - open-ness (i.e. proprietary/non-proprietary)
5. - ease of extensibility (i.e. ability to add more information cleanly at a
later data)
6. - internationalization
7. - un-abiguity of data representation
8. - unlimited size of data sets? (i.e. any limitation on character names,
lengths, item names, numbers, etc)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I'd vote that it should be non-proprietary (i.e. belonging to no one
developer - that's been one limitation on DELTA as a "standard") and
unlimited. I'd also say that under ease of authoring we should consider a
mythical taxonomist who has data stored in a spreadsheet - can they easily
fudge that data into the format (this is important in deciding between e.g.
tagged formats like XML for which the fudge would be difficult and matrix
formats).

3. WHAT ARE THE CORE DATA ELEMENTS

Here's the beginning of a list, mostly a summation of LucID and DELTA. Note
that this assumes that we're not simply tagging up descriptions.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TYPES OF DATA NEEDED FOR A DESCRIPTIVE DATA STANDARD

State-level scores:
 absent
 normally present
 rarely present (value?)
 uncertain
 present by misinterpretation

Character-level scores:
 not scored yet
 unknown
 inapplicable
 uncertain
.....do we need all these?
.....more?

Extra data:
 free-text comments attached to state scores
 state-score links ("/" vs "&" in DELTA)

Character types:
 Ordered Multistate
 Unordered Multistate
 Real Numeric
 Integer Numeric?
 Ordered Cyclic Multistate
 Free Text

Real Numeric Data:
 Minimum
 Normal Low
 Normal High
 Maximum
 Mean?
 Standard Deviation?
 N?

Set-level data
 links to other data sets
  - links to lower-level data
     e.g. specimen-level data to be summed into taxon-level data
     e.g. subkeys

  - links to higher-level data
     e.g. passing of information up and down taxonomic hierarchies
     e.g. superkeys

Multimedia data
 links from both character and taxon elements to any form of multimedia
including blob text documents
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Finally, I think we need to bear in mind at all times the practical
difficulties in wanting one format that's optimal for all things. My
experience has been that a format that's good for storing atomised
natural-language descriptions is not good for storing interactive key data
and vice versa. The idea of a universal data store that can be used for many
different purposes is a seductive one, and hence needs to be subject to
frequent reality checks.

Actually you're both wrong <G>. The formal description of the NEXUS format
was in Systematic Biology.

The full citation is:

Maddison, D.R., Swofford, D.L. and W.P. Maddison. 1997. NEXUS: An
extensible file format for systematic information. Syst. Biol. 46(4):590-621.

For what it's worth, the paper itself refers to a Web site
(http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/nexus/nexus.html) for "additions and proposed
additions to the format", but nothing seems to have been placed there, as
yet (though the site does provide "pseudo-code" for a NEXUS parser).

If the basic format contains the relevant data, then a phylogenetic tree
can be constructed from that data - so I'd have seen the above as
something that should be derived from your data set rather than stored
within it.

I assume "New Hampshire" = "Newick" format? If so, heres an XML equivalent.

<!ELEMENT label   (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT title   (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT branch (label?, branch*)>
<!ATTLIST branch length  CDATA    #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT newick  (branch?)>

Just something I was toying with before.

Given this, and other similar comments on the list, I'd suggest that an
additional requirement of any new format (if thats the way things go)
is that it provides backwards-compatibility, as far as possible with
other formats.

Granted this might well be lossy, but given the numbers of users of Nexus,
and the amount of software currently available, making efforts to
provide for data conversion between formats means that we don't
have to start completely from scratch.

The first thing I did with XDELTA was provide a stylesheet with produce
DELTA files. The same could be achieved for other formats.

Definitely, and this is an important point to make. XML is an enabler,
its not a magic-bullet. What types of problems have people met in attempting
to share characters between research efforts?

At a basic level, linking withing and between documents and data is
easy. Its defining the semantics of this, and ensuring that the data
retrieved is meaningful.

Sure element/attribute/value, but also element/element/content

i.e. <leaf shape="obvate" />
or

<leaf>
  <shape>obvate</shape>
</leaf>

Or did I miss something?

I'd suggest that something like this (expressing meta-data relationships
amongst elements) could be layered on top of a basic data description
format. RDF might provide the facility to do this effectively. I need
to revisit the spec.

Dear Computer Taxonomists,

The article by Maddison et al. on NEXUS didn't appeared either in
"Taxon" or "Systematic Botany", but in "Systematic Biology" (1997). I
posted the complete reference to the DELTA-L discussion list, about a
month ago...

Firstly, can I just say that the level of interest and debate on this topic
already is impressive - there are clearly a lot of us around the world banging
our heads against this one!

I guess it will take a little while to settle down to a rhythm of debate, and
finding the level and especially scope of the task at hand will necessarily
require some brain-storming in the early stages.

But I would like to make the general comment that we should be very clear
in our minds about keeping quite separate and distinct the task of defining
a new standard for descriptive data exchange, from the specific nature of the
data that the standard will be communicating.

The standard is required for capturing and exchanging data across all
kingdoms (and occasionally winds up being used for abiotic entities like
archaeological pottery shards - see Louhivuori, DELTA Newsletter 12, April 1996)!

Examples drawn from particular disciplines are extremely useful for
illustrating the requirements or functionality of elements within the existing
or proposed data standard, but have the potential to draw us into another
debate entirely - that of data sharing across projects.

As far as I can see this is the summary of this sub-groups task, as presented
in the welcome message on joining this list:

" the subgroup should attempt to analyze the requirements for a new standard
for descriptive data. The metaformat for the standard will probably be
based on XML or related formats. It is hoped that this standard
will reach universal recognition to become at some point a successor
to existing standards like DELTA, NEXUS, or XDF."

The general mechanism for exchanging descriptive data between software
applications and databases will have to be kept distinct from the definition
and meaning of  specific instances of descriptive data content, which I think
should (currently) be outside the scope of this list.

It's pretty clear from Don, Noel and now Leigh's comments that combining data
meaningfully across projects is a whole 'nother ballgame:

Just to answer Leigh's question from the previous paragraph, here in PERTH
we have made a serious attempt over the last seven years to capture descriptive
data in DELTA format in a number of projects with an underlying aim of sharing
characters across all projects.

Management of nested sets of characters and continued adherence to
character definition across projects over time and at various levels of the
taxonomic hierarchy has certainly been arduous at times, but the benefits of a
'corporate' approach to data capture are now becoming clear as the data is
seeing the light of day (see our FloraBase web site for some readily available
samples:   http://www.calm.wa.gov.au/science/florabase.html )

And we have made some useful progress in developing database applications
to aid in the process of amalgamating data reliably across projects.  For an early
discussion of some of the issues in managing institutional descriptive datasets
see Chapman and Choo, DELTA Newsletter 12, April 1996).

(NB. PDF versions of recent DELTA Newsletters are available at:
         http://www.calm.wa.gov.au/science/delta/news/index.html )

So, I'm not saying its not a rivetting subject - just that one headache at a time
is enough!

Cheers,
Alex

If the basic format contains the relevant data, then a phylogenetic tree
can be constructed from that data - so I'd have seen the above as
something that should be derived from your data set rather than stored
within it.

I assume "New Hampshire" = "Newick" format? If so, heres an XML equivalent.

<!ELEMENT label   (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT title   (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT branch (label?, branch*)>
<!ATTLIST branch length  CDATA    #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT newick  (branch?)>

Just something I was toying with before.

Given this, and other similar comments on the list, I'd suggest that an
additional requirement of any new format (if thats the way things go)
is that it provides backwards-compatibility, as far as possible with
other formats.

Granted this might well be lossy, but given the numbers of users of Nexus,
and the amount of software currently available, making efforts to
provide for data conversion between formats means that we don't
have to start completely from scratch.

The first thing I did with XDELTA was provide a stylesheet with produce
DELTA files. The same could be achieved for other formats.

Definitely, and this is an important point to make. XML is an enabler,
its not a magic-bullet. What types of problems have people met in attempting
to share characters between research efforts?

At a basic level, linking withing and between documents and data is
easy. Its defining the semantics of this, and ensuring that the data
retrieved is meaningful.

Sure element/attribute/value, but also element/element/content

i.e. <leaf shape="obvate" />
or

<leaf>
  <shape>obvate</shape>
</leaf>

Or did I miss something?

I'd suggest that something like this (expressing meta-data relationships
amongst elements) could be layered on top of a basic data description
format. RDF might provide the facility to do this effectively. I need
to revisit the spec.

This is the "official" publication for the XDF format, and is much less
detailed than the equivalent publication for NEXUS. I have however a few
detailed documents of the XDF specification, that were given to me by
Bob Allkin, some years ago. As far as I know, XDF has not been used
outside the scope of the ILDIS project, and I don't know if it is still
being maintained by White & Allkin (I will ask to Bob, as he is now
working here in Brazil). On peculiarity of this format is that it is
intended to be used for transfering data between relational databases,
as NEXUS is directed to the representation and transfer of phylogenetic
datasets.

I will be glad to send a copy of this documentation to someone in this
list who could distribute it to anyone interested in it (maybe I could
send it to Gregor?).

PS Just as an aside, do this informal (and intended to be fun) treatment

IMHO, this inter-compatibility of data sets is one of the Big Issues
that needs to be addressed.  I (initially) put all of my data into
DELTA and then converted it to Nexus.  The Nexus file has been heavily
modified (and many of my character and state names truncated in the
bargin).  Until very recently, there was no way to take *this* file
back into DELTA.  But more than that; all of the continuous data
in the original file (aka measurements) are now gone and will have to
be added back into the DELTA data set by hand.  :-(

Why not extend the current standards that if there are data types that
their particular application doesn't recognize, they stay around -- just
ignored.  MacClade does that even with Nexus data (maybe the newest one
doesn't); but if I save my file from within MacClade, if I want to run
PAUP again, there are commands that I must reinter into the file
because MacClade has removed them because it didn't understand them.

Of course, the IAPT shapes are not "real", they are conventions (the actual
circumscription of the various shapes was decided at a meeting back in the
'50s, I think).  As affording a communication device, the IAPT shape chart
is excellent, and exactly what is needed (see below), as a means for
measuring the world, it is definitely inferior to metrics such as
millimeters and degrees.  The states, the 0s and 1s, of phylogenetic
analyses, are treated far more as IAPT shape charts than as the results of
measured and analysed variation for my liking.  Ideally - and I stress
"ideally" - basic taxonomic data should be metric-type data (and images of
things like pollen surface, perhaps wood anatomy) linked to specimen,
rather as with d.n.a., where a sequence is deposited in GenBank and lnked
to a specimen.  I am not suggesting that all our taxonomic work should be
so anchored, but I am suggesting that far more than at present should be so
treated.  Many morphological data sets consists of little more than
unsubstantiated assertions about the world.  If, however, somebody asked me
for a flora treatment of some 'well" understood group for N. Amerias, I
would probably have no reasonable alternative (because one's life is
limited...) than to use whatever communication conventions exist for what I
am looking at.  (However, if a group had been monographed following more
ideal standards, think how easy it would be to produce local accounts of
variation, not to mention distribution maps, etc., etc.)

And thinking of things like terms used in describing organisms, there
certainly seems room for either synonymy tables and/or for more IAPT-type
conventions.  This is particularly true of genus- and family-"level"
descriptions in plants - for teaching purposes, I am reading descriptions
of genera and families in an edited compendium, and there may be three or
four words for what is arguably the same thing, or terms that acutally make
it more, not les, difficult, to get to grips with the basic variation.

I almost entirely agree with Peter.

Most existing formats deal not with data per se, but rather with
representations of data.  0's and 1's in phylogenetic analysis are an obvious
example.  While either value could represent a particular molecular base pair
substitution, it need not and will, almost certainly, rarely reflect actual
measurement of a particular specimen or series of specimens, even though such
information would be required in some measure or estimation to actually  reach
the "higher-order inference".

I too would argue that what we seek is a system that distinguishes between
"observations", measured in some sense (either directly using some device), or
perhaps "mapped" using known or widely used conventions and higher level
abstractions that often pass as qualitative "data", (ie leaf "ovate" or state
"relatively derived" or "1").

Because science requires assumptions be made, it is clear that in many areas,
such representations are routinely assumed, with much or relatively little
justification, as the issues require.  Consequently, our "matrix" would be
extremely sparse should one insist that only "measured variables" be specified
as "character data" to reach the abstractions needed to conduct some kinds of
investigations (ie. pooling museum records for a given species, whose taxonomy
is established on the basis of morphology).  Delta and Nexus serve well in
variety of contexts.  However, one would also like to be able to request the
"intersection" of a variety of "weakly associated" or
"semi-structured" information that might facilitate determining what the
distribution and taxonomic conclusions might be for select sub-populations
measured for a number of potentially widely different
"features/properties/potential synonyms".

To use the XML analogy, perhaps we need a tag language that
"wrap" "representations of data", as well as other tags that indicate the
circumstances under which "measured variables" were actually taken (eg.
measurements taken from landmarks that may subtly differ among investigators;
device used; preparation methods, etc.).  In any case we need a means to
distinguish between these two [maybe more?] "fundamental [?] types" of "data",
while at formulate a searching/description language at the same time rich
enough to characterize reasonably precisely the context in which the
representations were made, as well as the objects themselves.

If I disagree with Peter, it is that for at least a set of morphological
features that can be imaged, we are rapidly approaching a day when it will be
possible to measure thousands of objects each for thousands of measures
quickly.  For these, automated, well-defined definitions of shape will no
longer be an issue (except perhaps which method/measure is most useful for a
particular or general purpose).  Rather, the issue is how can we set up a
system of describing such measured data that allows us to evaluate it against
taxonomic and morphological conclusions reached in the past using other
methods, not to mention compare it against other molecular, developmental,
physiological, and ecological data collected using a wide variety of techniques
collected in the past and to be collected in the future.  Also, comparison of
methods for taking such data will become increasingly important as the devices
(hardware and software) become ever more sophisticated and our language or
interpreting their output becomes increasingly precise.

Perhaps a useful approach might be to evaluate various "data types" separately
to establish the appropriate set of "context" tags (the essence of DELTA,
LUCID, NEXUS and related approaches), while also seeking to better understand
the nature of the "conceptual wrappers" that will be needed to associate (tag)
different contexts.  At least such an approach might permit comparison of the
controlled vocabularies of alternative tagging methods where there is content
and concept overlap.  Such an approach might also permit us to assess just what
kinds of associations we need to be able to make, and hence what kind of
language do we need to construct to permit "multi-dimensional" extensions.

Would it be too simplistic to simply allow the format to express
the source (qualitative/quantitative, or a more detailed description)
or a particular data set?

Deciding which sources you trust, value, or otherwise wish to
manipulate is an option you then have at the application level.

i.e. "I wish only direct measures of leaf shape, and not
a description such as 'ovate'.

If you also wanted to map between these measures
("give me an approximate textual description given these measurements")
then this again lies at the application level and can be achieved
assuming the data format is expressive enough.

Again allowing the format to express source of data origin and means
of origin allows this kind of processing to be deferred to the next
processing layer (the application, or additional metadata information).

Or am I missing the point here?

This is typical of the level of malpractice of those who seem to be taking the
running with this discussion. Can you imagine being so clumsy and foolhardly

IMHO, this inter-compatibility of data sets is one of the Big Issues
that needs to be addressed.  I (initially) put all of my data into
DELTA and then converted it to Nexus.  The Nexus file has been heavily
modified (and many of my character and state names truncated in the
bargin).  Until very recently, there was no way to take *this* file
back into DELTA.  But more than that; all of the continuous data
in the original file (aka measurements) are now gone and will have to
be added back into the DELTA data set by hand.  :-(

Why not extend the current standards that if there are data types that
their particular application doesn't recognize, they stay around -- just
ignored.  MacClade does that even with Nexus data (maybe the newest one
doesn't); but if I save my file from within MacClade, if I want to run
PAUP again, there are commands that I must reinter into the file
because MacClade has removed them because it didn't understand them.

Patience Nick - new lists take a while to settle down as participants
try and establish a common agenda, and people strut personal favorite
products and ideologies.

Like Bernie, I am waiting for the discussion to focus itself.

I had initially thought we were looking at a common and comprehensive
(interchange?) format for biological descriptive data, perhaps
involving an information model of the topic we are dealing with, and
importantly, its boundaries.  But all too quickly we have got to the
level of all things to all people end-products, software and a degree
of daunting complexity that we could probably do without at this stage.

Approaching things from an 'if it aint broke dont fix it' point of
view, is someone in a position to enunciate/tabulate exactly what it is
we are trying to achieve and the shortcomings/limitations of exiting
formats in reaching this goal?  Having done this we might be better
able to partition things into managable and achievable lumps.  I was not
at the Harvard meeting so I'm a bit reluctant to stick an oar in, but
since when has ignorance been a reason not to have an opinion... :)

All the suggestions of 'do it this way using this', while interesting
and educational, are tending to obscure rather than clarify what it is
we are tring to achieve.

Well, I am getting a bit lost, and I love this data stuff...

Too simplistic, I think. There will surely be many cases where in one data
set some characters will be "real" (i.e. low-level) observations while
others will be abstractions. For instance, sometimes it will be viewed as
worthwhile for the taxonomist to capture real data (leaf shapes are fairly
easy to do), other times anything other than abstraction is practically
impossible (try working out how to capture indumentum characteristics
quantitatively).

This worries me.  Is the entity/property/value schema restricted to 3
levels? (ditto for XMLs element/attribute/value). If so, it seems too much
of a straightjacket, especially if we want to express a hierarchy of
elements like this. What to do about
leaf/lamina/abaxial_surface/vein_islands/indumentum/density.
I agree that a hierarchically structured schema may be wonderful, but in a
biological context I wouldn't like to see it constrained at 3 levels just
because that's what existing computer formats do.

No sooner said than done :-). See

A comparison of formats for descriptive data
http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/www/compdata.htm

Actually, I've been working on this for a few days, but have been
hampered by some administrative work (a review of our project).

The document is rather sketchy at the moment, and I will correct and
add to it as time permits. There may be quite a few errors in the
information on Nexus/Paup/MacClade. Also, I haven't yet had time to
incorporate some of the suggestions made on this list.

The paper I presented at the recent TDWG meeting is also available:

Introduction to data requirements for natural-language descriptions
    and identification.

You wrote:
leaf/lamina/abaxial_surface/vein_islands/indumentum/density

This is exactly an XPath ( http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath.html ) query, it will
select all <density> elements children of <indumentum> elements children of ...
etc.

Other example:
lamina[ancestor(species)//petal[contains(./text(),'white')]]
will select <lamina> elements descendant of <species> elements, whose <petal>
element's text content has 'white' string in it.

The whole thing is to set a botanical vocabulary, allowing indumentum and
disallowing (e.g.) pilosity. This is a secondary issue wether this vocabulary
will be a DTD, an XML Schema, or a RDF Schema. Anyway, there are tools like XML
Authority of Extensibility to translate beetwen these formats (not yet RDF
Schema, alas), so we can provide all Schema dialects. This is what most business
Consortia do.

For the relational database fans, it is easy to export a many-columns table using
a XSLT (http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt.html) transform, with columns names exactly
like this:
leaf/lamina/abaxial_surface/vein_islands/indumentum/density

For the DELTA fans, the principle is to associate a character number to each
leaf, like
leaf/lamina/abaxial_surface/vein_islands/indumentum/density
of the document Schema. It can be done even without DTD/Schema, see
http://jmvanel.free.fr/Samples/DisplayDescriptions/speciesGUI.htm, where I list
all the unique nested tags names in the document; this is what I call the
implicit Schema. I do Javascript with the Document Object Model.

I have proposals to extend the DELTA system; this will be another thread.

Dear Computer Taxonomists,

I have just taken a look at the documents recently announced by Mike
Dallwitz. They look nice, and the  comparison of formats for descriptive
data seems especially useful. However, I have noticed the complete
absence of the XDF format. It seems that if we are engaging in a
comprehensive comparison of formats for biological descriptive data, XDF
deserves a little more attention. Perhaps it has not been widely used,
but notwithstanding one of its main applications has been quite
impressive - the importing of a large part of the Missouri Botanical
Garden TROPICOS database to the use of the ILDIS Project. And this
happened more than a decade ago, in the pre-Web era, and before all the
current interest in distributed databases and metadata.

I hope to find some time in the near future for trying to put some
documentation on XDF on the Web, for our general use.

Aren't observations made by looking at specimens and measurements taken from
'organs' (or whatever constituent parts of specimen)?

The taxonomic philosophers might well argue that all characters are
abstractions, that the concept that a leaf has shape is an abstraction. In
terms of the 'reality' of statement you might make about the shape of a
leaf, it doesn't really matter whether you describe shape using standard
terms or as set of coordinates or as an elliptic fourier coefficient. Surely
the way you measure an attribute depends on what you are going to use the
measurements for, ultimately that's a question of precision. If there is a
possibility that there will be a variety of uses (reuse) for the data, then
an indictation of the degree of precision of the measurement would be highly
desirable.

Isn't it also important to distinguish whether the description refers to an
actual leaf (ie. that leaf there, on that specimen is ovate) or whether you
are making a generalisation about a taxon (ie leaves ovate to obovate)? A
taxon cannot have a leaf shape, only leaves can, and an actual leaf does not
usually vary in shape except through time.

So if the reality is;

"I looked at two specimens; from specimen x I measured 3 leaves and their
shapes were ovate, ovate and obovate; from specimen y I measured 2 leaves,
the first was ovate, the second obovate"

Then why not say so?

<my_taxon_description>
   <specimen>
      <leaf shape="ovate"/>
      <leaf shape="ovate"/>
      <leaf shape="obovate"/>
   </specimen>
   <specimen>
      <leaf shape="ovate"/>
      <leaf shape="obovate"/>
   </specimen>
</my_taxon_description>

For a generalised statement about my taxon, all I need is an aggregate
function for the listed values of leaf shape.

It seems that very few 'real' observations are formally recorded but we have
a lot of generalisations.

"leaves ovate to obovate, 5--31 mm long"

What can be deduced about the relationship between leaf shape and leaf
length?
At what point in the exercise or recording observations should the decision
be made that this information either is or is not important?

<my_taxon_description>
   <specimen>
      <leaf shape="ovate" length_mm="10"/>
      <leaf shape="ovate" length_mm="8"/>
      <leaf shape="obovate" length_mm="25"/>
   </specimen>
   <specimen>
      <leaf shape="ovate" length_mm="5"/>
      <leaf shape="obovate" length_mm="31"/>
   </specimen>
</my_taxon_description>

Maybe the ovate leaves are all immature, or there's some enivironmental
factor. Maybe I don't want to know, but maybe I do.

No not at all, theoretically you can have as many levels in the hierarchy
you like;
element/element/...nth element/attribute/value

One (RDF centric) way to model this would be to treat leaf, lamina,
abaxial_surface, vein_islands, indumentum as nested elements, and an
attribute called density which will have a value (let's say "sparse");

<My_description>
   <leaf>
      <lamina>
         <vein_islands>
            <indumentum density="sparse"/>
         </vein_islands>
      </lamina>
   </leaf>
</My_description>

or more in line with the conventional (DELTA, NEXUS) approach, simply as a
single element with an attribute (called density) and a value;

<My_description>
        <leaf_lamina_abaxial_surface vein_islands_indumentum density="sparse"/>
</My_description>

In the latter case you've lost a lot of contextual information, but the
approach (elements have properties that have values) might still offer
improved consistency in definition of descriptors .
Many of us, probably quite naturally, end up defining characters in this
way, but there are may examples to the contrary, and none of the existing
formats seem either expect or enforce this discipline.

I believe that original measurement data should be part of the data
set, together with rules how to map them unto categorical data
(DELTA: "Keystate directive"). Knowing that categorical states for,
e.g. length-to-width-ratio of a leaf have been measured rather than
just guessed, solves only a small part of the problem.

but ovate is rather difficult to parameterize. It may be possible to
get ellipsoidal parameters, but width and length are clearly
insufficient.

Does anybody know about good parameterization of shapes, so they can
be stored in more objective forms?

Dear Colleagues

I welcome all the new members of the list! Currently 96 people have
subscribed, that is considerably more than I expected. However, only
few people from the NEXUS community have subscribed.

As it should be, the discussion is already in full flow. If those
people who have signed up late want to catch up, please can go to the
web archive (http://usobi.org/archives/tdwg-sdd.html).

Perhaps we should try to add some more structure (Kevin already made
some suggestions), but in any case just keep posting everything you
think relevant.

Regarding the general purpose of this list and the manager (Mauro's
question), I post the welcome message below. Most of you have already
received this, but some early subscribers did not or received an
earlier version.

Separate postings with minutes and a provisional outline will follow.

 TDWG-SDD, Discussion List on the Structure of Descriptive Data

To post a message to the list, send email to tdwg-sdd@usobi.org
from your subscribed email address. Include a meaningful Subject
line.

In general, use only plain text in the main body of your message,
and put HTML or other formatted text/graphics in attachments.
This will make it easier for other subscribers to read the
message, and very importantly, it will allow the LISTSERVer to
create useful search terms from you message's main body.

TDWG is the Taxonomic Databases Working Group. The mission of TDWG
can be found at http://www.tdwg.org/. The subgroup "Structure of
Descriptive Data" was started 1998 at the TDWG meeting in Reading. At
the TDWG meeting in Harvard in Oct 1999 it was agreed that the
subgroup should attempt to analyze the requirements for a new standard
for descriptive data. The metaformat for the standard will probably be
based on XML or related formats. It is hoped that this standard
will reach universal recognition to become at some point a successor
to existing standards like DELTA, NEXUS, or XDF.

The purpose of this discussion list is to foster communication and
collaboration among those involved in the creation of a new standard.
The new standard should be carefully drafted and agreed upon by
consensus.

The discussion list provides an email- and www-accessible archive
(available at http://usobi.org/archives/tdwg-sdd.html) so that the
discussion is adequately documented. The list is expected to produce
some traffic, including attached formatted documents (HTML +
graphics). If you are concerned about too many emails flooding in,
please consider whether your email client offers an automatic filter
function to directly copy all mails originating from the list into a
separate folder.

To unsubscribe from the list you should send an email to

We had several comments on NEXUS so far.

I agree with Kevin (and Leigh), that "users of NEXUS are more than happy
with their format". However, I don't think they should be, exactly because
the situation Susan is commenting on. NEXUS is by far more specialized and
that much information is lost when restricting a data set to NEXUS. If
NEXUS does not change, it would sooner or later become a one-way format,
and would not be used for data storage any more.

That does not mean that NEXUS is not a good format, but I believe we do
need a format that is covering all the common ground. We should try to
learn from NEXUS as we should try to learn from DELTA.

I believe this backward compatibility will be possible, at least in a one-
way situation. With this I mean that a simple XML program (given the new
program is based on XML) will be able to provide DELTA or NEXUS formatted,
that can be read by older programs.

However, if the new format is really a redesign and not just a superset of
competing directives, some information may be lost, and some information
may have to be mapped in a way that will usually provide the best results.

I believe that a new format is more desirable than blowing up existing
formats beyond their design specifications. I think the latter is the main
problem that I have with the proposals for "New Delta": The discussion and
proposals correctly identify many shortcomings, which I consider very
valuable work.  However, resolving these issue in the context of the
existing DELTA format structures, and especially in close context to the
way the CSIRO DELTA programs currently work, has lead to many solutions
which I consider undesirable.

Minutes of the Subgroup "Structure of descriptive data" workshop at
TDWG 1999 in Harvard

----------------------

The subgroup convened on Sunday, 31.10.99 during the annual TDWG
meeting at Harvard University. The following topics were discussed:

1. Diederich's "Basic properties"

General agreement was reached that a direct application of the
"structure-property-value" model would be too restrictive, applicable
mainly to morphological descriptions. A more general model, including
cultural/physiological and molecular descriptions should be
developed. The term "feature" was proposed as a more general
replacement for structure.

2. Standardization of schemas (character definitons), user defined
metadata

This was considered desirable in the long run, but, esp.considering
the experiences made by Richard Pankhurst with plant descriptors, it
should be considered a long term goal. The problems were shortly
discussed. Agreement was reached that these topics are quite separate
and should be discussed in separate discussion groups.

3. New interchange format for descriptors

It was proposed that a new "Superset format", encompassing the
functionality of the existing DELTA and NEXUS interchange formats,
and with extensions to support the requirements of LucID,
DeltaAccess, and possible further software packages should be
developed. However, it was agreed that we should first step back to
review the current use of descriptors. The new format should not be a
simple superset with possible redundancy, but the principles of
biological descriptions should be reevaluated to cover them with
appropriate and general mechanisms. To achieve a clearer picture, a
requirement analysis was proposed (see next point).

A distinction was made between the data model and the metaformat. It
was agreed that XML may be a good vehicle for a new standard.
However, alternatives should be carefully evaluated. A decision for
or against XML would have to be made only after the requirement
analysis and information model had sufficiently far progressed.
An important point was made that the standard should belong to TDWG,
and should neither in name nor in the preparation of future versions
be too intimately tied to any developer of a software application.
The relationship to existing standards TDWG-DELTA or NEXUS should be
clearly defined and mapping definitions provided.

4. Requirement analysis

A requirement analysis is to be made, separately for general and
application type specific requirements. The general requirements
should be discussed according to a preliminary information model.

5. How to proceed

The group agreed to communicate over an email listserver (which will
be installed at the University of Kansas with the help of Jim Beach).
It was agreed that the documents to be discussed should in simple
cases be send directly as plain text in the body of an email, or in
the case of longer, structured and formatted documents, in the form
of HTML attachments. The use of PDF should be avoided, since it can
not be directly read and is difficult to annotate and consolidate
annotations.

A web page will document the consolidated discussion papers and the
emendations or criticisms regarding these papers. In addition, the
list server will directly provide an unedited archive of the original
discussion.

Time frame: It was considered desirable to have a definite proposal
by a years time.

The following is an attempt to structure the topics that must be
discussed. On a first level, I believe we need to discuss:

(GEN) General topics, e.g. discussion about the agenda in general,
      standardization process in general, perhaps exploration of
      funding possibilites to organize one or several workshops.

(RQT) Requirement analysis and information model for descriptive
      information in biology: Stepping back and asking ourselves what
      we need in terms of information model, entities/attributes or
      functionality. We should try to create an outline here to
      further structure this discussion

(XML) Exploration of the suitability or desirability of XML to be
      used as a metaformat for a new exchange format for descriptive
      data (incl. discussion of XML-Data, XML-Schema, XML-RDF, names
      spaces, Dublin Core, etc.

What else? RQT and XML should definitely be structured further. I
will make a proposal for RQT tomorrow.

Please:
- Always use a subject line
- If possible, add the outline code (GEN, RQT, XML) and perhaps the
  number in the outline for this topic after your own subject in
  brackets. See the example for (GEN) in this posting.
- When responding to a posting, please delete any information you are
  not commenting on. Do not just leave the entire posting as quoted
  text before or after your own text!

I believe that structuring will help the discussion, but please feel
free at any time to submit a discussion paper on any topic you
consider important!

Wouldn't the most objective representation of shape be given by a set of
coordinates for points placed around the outline? If orientation of the
object is important, then give landmark coordinates too eg. mark the organ
base and apex. From that info, parameters such as object area, perimeter
length, circularity (perimeter length*perimeter length/area), centroid,
longest and shortest axes, aspect ratios etc. can be calculated.

You'd also be able to standardise your outlines (eg. using Bookstein's
transformation) and compare against reference shapes (eg elliptic fourier
analysis), pairwise comaprisons using (thin plate splines) or fit to average
shape using Procrustes metric.

Feature extraction from digital images (eg defining the object outline,
sampling of points around outline)and calculation of the shape parameters
and export to spreadsheet is virtually automatic in packages like OPTIMAS.
James Rolf's NTsysPC will perform the basic standardisations, thin plate
splines and EFA.

Source and precision stuff is surely important, but it is quite possible to
end up with major bloat and more meta than meaningful data.  This may not
be a problem but there is certainly a practical limit as to how far we can
or should go in this direction.

Most certainly.  I must admit I thought we were talking about taxon
descriptive  data, but therie is probalby no reason at all why the same
principles and data structure/definitions can not be used forthe
structures/features themselves.

>A taxon cannot have a leaf shape, only leaves can, and an actual leaf does

Conversely, only a taxon can have, or not have, ovate leaves.  Is this a
generalization or a fact?  (and does it matter?)

Conceptually I like this reperesentation - it is what we all do and may or

they don't...

I really like this open ended nested or hierachical approach to characters
and the contextual and relational information it brings with it.  It would
be really nice to be able to handle this arangement of data in a DELTA or
DELTA-like application.  There are instances where it would be very useful
and certainly improve ease of drilling through large character sets.
However, data-wise, it is a lot more verbose, and you could up with a lot
of repetition to describe similar indumentum on leaves, stems, pedicels,
fruit, etc.; but if someone wants to build such a thing, I sure we could
live with this... :)

I don't think there is any internal constraint within XML that would restrict
one to evaluating hierarchial relationships, if these were the most suitable, to
only 3 levels.   Some parsers may actually be constrained to work with a finite
level of nestedness, but I would suspect that it would be much greater than 3
deep.  I would think as is the case for object or relational modeling one could
instantiate one to many or many to one relationships as required.

My original point here was only that it is often difficult to decide how to
represent concepts that associate objects/entities/roles.  In one context it
would be appropriate to say regard a leaf as an entity, its shape as an
attribute, and ovate as a value.  However, (and again this is probably not be
the best example) in another context a leaf of the same plant might be regarded
as a attribute of yet another object/entity, perhaps a tree, and not considered
an entity on its own.  A particular implementation, such as one using XML, will
often provide a variety choices for representing the underlying ideas, but until
we model/conceptualize how the various conceptual components
interoperate/relate, a particular approach can often be difficult to evaluate or
to extend.

Further, I didn't mean to imply that all conceptual associations among character
data types would be hierarchial.  It was probably a poor choice of words on my
part and I believe such a restriction would greatly limit the range of
investigators who might be able to contribute and substantially limit the number
of taxa or morphs that could be so characterized.  There could be a large number
of potential representations, including: trees, cyclic acyclic or directional
graphs, lattices, semilattices, ordered sets, partially ordered sets, Galois
connections, tensorial decompositions, etc.  My point was that I believe we need
to identify the critical conceptual relations and their context in a "standard"
model for character data and to then formulate a language (implementation [in
XML?]) for describing the most meaningful or useful among them.

This language would presumably be a superset of existing methods.  To use the
terminology of Ganter and Wille (1996.  Formal Concept Analysis.  Springer.) in
its simplest form, it might be useful to speak, as closely as possible, in terms
of formal contexts, such as K := (G, M, I),  which consists of two sets G
(objects)and M (attributes) and I the incidence relation betwen G and M of the
context, AND the formal concept of the context (G, M, I), namely a pair (A, B),
where A is the extent and B the intent, and where A C G (C meaning subset not
"C") and B C M, A' = B and B' = A, where A' := {m e M | gIm for all g e A} and
B' := {g e G | gIm for all m e B}.  (reading e as "is an element of").
Fortunately, even for many-valued contexts, these can be represented as simple
cross tables.  Already, we have considered several including 1) matrices of 0's
and 1's 2) taxon by measure matrices, 3) range matricies for a given specimen,
4) specimen x location matricies, 5) species by location matrices...  No doubt
others may  think of lots of other possibilities.

A useful approach might then be to approximate the "quasi"-complete concept
lattice B*(G, M, I) of a context derived from gluing (union of) concept lattices
of a large number of relevant contexts and then identifying the most
meaningful/useful/easily encoded congruent sublattices, factors, and
implications between attributes, ignoring, at least initially, issues of scale,
closure, and incomparability.  Such an approach might thus permit working
subgroups to focus on particular forms/types of character data and their most
appropriate/useful/efficient representation.  It might also permit us to collate
useful lists of works/websites employing particular kinds of representations for
an eventual website characterizing the emerging potential standard or
recommendation.

Admittedly, such a more general view of what would be required to model
"character data" creates some tangential considerations with respect to
straightforward conversion among existing formats, certainly a worthy and
perhaps more immediately necessary goal.  Such a subdiscussion  would be roughly
equivalent to enumerating the rules by which existing approaches encode various
contexts and concepts and then establishing a uniform syntax to describe the
common rules among them.  However, as Peter and Gregor (at the meeting)
indicated, it would be desirable to permit extensions that allow observational
data (ie things that are measured) to be recognized as distinct from, as well as
related to, what we might be loosely call conceptual data (representations that
bear a greater degree of inference, such as 0's and 1's in phylogenetic data,
leaf "shape" "ovate", or leaf color "green" etc.), so that one is in a better
position to 1) verify the accuracy of the former, perhaps using alternate
techniques, 2) study the relations between and properties of the two kinds of
data, 3) test assumptions explict or implicit in the latter, 4) develop
machine-assisted search/display/evaluation techniques for 1) 2) 3) across a wide
range of independent data sets in a variety of contexts.

If this is too radical a restructuring of the original intent of the discussion
that may have been more narrowly focused (I didn't attend the initial setup
meeting at Harvard that took place outside the main meeting room), I would be
content to continue discussion of such general considerations among a smaller or
alternate subgroup, assuming there is anyone else who feels likewise inclined.
In any event, hopefully discussions of character data representations focused
toward a potential emerging standard will be robust enough to include relatively
novel formats, such as that involved in range data, and their conceptual
relations to more traditional data types.

I saw this in:

Minutes of the Subgroup "Structure of descriptive data" workshop at
TDWG 1999 in Harvard

     Diederich's "Basic properties"
     General agreement was reached that a direct application of the

     "structure-property-value" model would be too restrictive,
     applicable
     mainly to morphological descriptions. A more general model,
     including
     cultural/physiological and molecular descriptions should be
     developed. The term "feature" was proposed as a more general
     replacement for structure.

This feature-property-value triology is what I had in mind the first
time I read about Delta.
A few remarks:

  1. the feature can be a hierarchy, like:

leaf/lamina/abaxial_surface/vein_islands/indumentum/density

   * the property can default to an "unnamed property", that is a
     textual content for the feature as a whole; this allows to import
     directly floristic descriptions, see
     http://jmvanel.free.fr/Samples/parsing.htm;
   * we can turn the Flora of Australia GLOSSARY in a XML vocabulary in
     XML Schema or RDF Schema syntax; each glossary entry should be
     classified either as a feature, or a property, or a property-value;
   * the current characters of Delta are in fact feature-property
     couples;
   * the current type of characters of Delta (multistate=enumerate,
     integer, real numeric, text) will become type information for
     properties in our new Taxonomic XML Schema; there is a standard for
     data types in the 2nd part of W3C's XML Schema recommandation; we
     must avoid to re-invent the wheel;
   * the proposed XDELTA format (http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ccslrd/delta/)
     is too much a direct translation of a Delta file;
   * I propose to have 3 XML Namespaces for our different XML
     vocabularies:
        o biological descriptions (generalities)
        o botany
        o zoology
   * XML Namespaces are important to avoid name clashes, they will allow
     us to mix in descriptions or reports with other vocabularies from
     other origins, like biochemical,  paleontological, ecological,
     phytosociological, pedological, climatic, agronomic, plant uses,
     ethnobotany, etc... (again avoid re-invent the wheel)

All together this is a sound and state-of-the-art XML foundation; of
course a lot of details are left.

Putting my programmer hat on here -- this debate may seem endless;
but before one can define how data looks, one must have an idea of
what goes into it.  I have no more knowledge of what an entomologist's
needs are in that respect than he does of a botanists (or even of
a synantherologist to a bryologist).

If I'm going to define a group of objects to define the morphology
of my organisms (in my case of members of the Trilliaceae), I'll
have a small set.  If I want to make my program/definitions
useful enough to a vascular plant person (or anybody else who wants
to record data outside my tiny group of organisms), then there's a
whole nother set of definitions that I'll need to include.
I don't think that we're trying to get to the definition level --
especially not immediately (or at least I don't think so), but
for this kind of work I think a Data Dictionary would be a useful
thing to have available at some point.

The second point to consider is that all of the other standards have
their shortcommings.  This one will probably have its shortcommings
as well -- no standard is perfect.  We can't hope to address those
problems in this standard if we're not aware of the shortcommings
in the other ones.

Are existing methods and this discussion restricted to "morphological characters"?

I think it would be much more useful to broadly define a character as "a feature or
property that varies among taxa as defined for a given basis of comparison."  This
could be a morphological trait as it often will be for taxonomic considerations.
However, characters can be defined for a molecular, physiological, ecological, and
behavioral bases (the last perhaps less so for plants).  This would greatly broaden
the potential group of users and begin the much needed dialog among disciplines that
are not defined by the taxa themselves.  Even among morphologists and taxonomists,
there are many of us who seek to understand morphology in a variety of contexts.

How are non-morphological characters treated by contemporary methods (besides 0's
and 1's)?

Note that these comments are based on what is currently available in
the current versions of Paup (more Paup 3.1.1 rather than Paup*)
and MacClade that I've been using -- not the published standard.
I can get the version number for the MacClade that I've been using,
if that will help.

You can have numeric characters in your data, but they must be "hard coded,"
(e.g., character #4 "number of leaves" with states "1. three," "2. four," etc.

You can't put comments in your character matrix but you can put comments
in your state names and character labels section.

There's not an unlimited number of states.  Paup will let you have about
36 I think, but MacClade allows less.  I know I had to combine some of
mine to get the data set into MacClade.  Practically, unless you're modeling
color (which I was) this is usually equivalent to an unlimited number of
states,

Character notes and illustrations only in MacClade.  If you revert/convert
to Paup, you loose all that information.

Taxon and character names are limited to the number of characters.  If
I"m not mistaken this is only true in MacClade.  Either that or MacClade
is once again "shorter" than Paup.

Multi-state characters -- they handle this wierd -- and differently.  It
used to be that they all had to be either AND or OR.  And it's not even
a true AND or OR type situation.  It's mostly an OR, but not quite.
(And I know that this is making *no* sense whatsoever!)  Multiple states
tend to be interpreted as uncertainty rather than polymorphism.  YOu
can now make that distinction, but it is still polymorphic rather than
all of the above at the same time.

Inapplicable is treated as missing.  There's really no other way to do it.
If you have an apealout plant, all the petal characters can either be
treated as "missing" or you can have an extra state "not applicable."
Then, you run into the problem of that extra state providing support that
otherwise might not be there.

I'm not aware of value probabilities in either Paup or MacClade.

The same situation applies to taxon notes and taxon illustrations.  Those
are only good in MacClade.

The typesetting markup in MacClade is only for HTML rather than typsetting.

Anyway, I hope this helps.  Maybe you can get some other experiential
comments about Paup and MacClade.

Hello XML'ers,

A few minor comments with regard to Jean-Marc's recent proposals which, on
the whole, I find intriguing:

I wouldn't have thought that "density" would be the feature, but rather
the property, i.e.:

 feature = leaf/lamina/abaxial_surface/vein_islands/indumentum
 property = density
 value = (some value)

Would properties be reified into features (as is done in RDF), or will
there be some other way to deal with properties of properties?
Intensifiers such as "very", for example.

Note: the XML Schema part 2 of November 1999 is a Working Draft, not even
a Proposed Recommendation, let a alone a Recommendation.

Of course, since its intent is to be a direct translation of the DELTA
format, this is not exactly a failing of the XDELTA format.

I'm sure you don't mean to leave out Mycology, Bryology, etc.

(XML) means a post about XML (see Gregor Hagedorn's post, "First level
topics on this list (GEN)"; every post should bear a tag among RQT, XML,
GEN).

By the way, this kind of tagging is much in the spirit of XML. Even in
an HTML text, you can mark up a sentence, a paragraph, or words, with
tags like <requirement>, <opinion>, <example>, <reference-to-article>,
etc. To identify this family of tags (called a vocabulary), it is better
(though not mandatory) to indicate that this fragment of HTML text is
using this vocabulary (say, in this example, called
authoring-discussion).

Here is a complete example:

     <HTML  xmlns:disc="urn:authoring-discussion" ><!-- N1 -->
     <!-- N2 --><STYLE>
     disc\:opinion{color:red; font-size:large;}
     </STYLE>
     <P>
     Everybody agrees that ......; but I think that
     <disc:opinion>modelizing amphibians is very
     important and a very special case</disc:opinion>.
     </P>
     </HTML>

You can copy-and-paste this into an example.html file, and see it in
Internet Explorer 5, or Mozilla, or any XHTML+CSS1 compliant browser.
For your conveniance, this file is joined to the post.

Notes:
N1    xmlns is a reserved word meaning "XML namespace"; the string
following = can be:

   * a URN, that is an Unique Resource Name, (see RFC 2396, it's only
     required to remain globally unique and persistent ) as in this
     example,

     on the Internet, like
     http://www.w3.org/DTD/authoring-discussion.dtd , which in our

     (XML Data Type Definition) or another syntax like XML Schema.

N2   This is a CSS1 style; complete specification in

There many topics more about XML, like:

   * how to format and query an XML document (XSLT),
   * what's going on in the business and scientific domains around XML
   * relations beetwen XML and HTML,

1. About the concept of features see 1rst post of this discussion, and my post
"feature-property-value"

2.About other disciplines see my post "Re: The end of DELTA?", about how an entomologist
might refer to a plant accessible on the net, not only simply linking to it like an HTML
hyperlink, but ASSERTING SOMETHING about this plant, thus ADDING INFORMATION about this
plant without changing anything on the plant's site.

(RQT) means requirements (see Gregor Hagedorn's post, "First level topics on this list
(GEN)"; every post should bear a tag among RQT, XML, GEN).

Approaches to evaluating OUTLINES include:

Freeman Chain Code Encoding

Chris Meacham's MorphoSys package uses a Freeman Chain Code to automatically
identify and encode points along the perimeter of a target object using video
digitization, as well as along the edge of holes within it.  There is a
published citation for this, but I can not find it at the moment.  This is not
a parametric technique since it generates a point set for which no parameters
must be either calculated.

Fourier Descriptors and Their Applications in Biology
by Pete E. Lestrel (Editor), Cambridge University Press, 1997.

As I recall, this has a paper using Kuhl and Giardina to identify
many species of oak and maple trees algorithmically.

As a biologically naive outsider, I would have thought that there is
an interesting problem of authority for statistical characters not
much different from other authority questions, namely
how/where/who/when were the statistical parameters estimated. My
impression about Elliptical Fourer Descriptors---which I think is a
neat idea---is that the literature is mostly devoted to showing that
they work, and not to otherwise collecting parameter estimates.

A student of mine implemented Kuhl and Giardina in matlab and my
recollection is that you can make EFD's independent of size and
orientation, so sloppy scanning can do pretty well. However, fall came
to New England, the semester and her interestd waned and we never
tested her implementation. If I'm right that this is robust to size
and orientation, then it would be a cute citizen science
application. People could send their leaf images to a central server,
and hordes of biology students could then quickly (or slowly) assign a
species in furtherence of the parameter estimate. David Hearn is doing
something like this at
http://ag.arizona.edu/~dhearn/help/PlantID.html.

In a CD of course. And not in 5 years...

There is a strong necessity to have an exhaustive coverage of species.
A telephone directory with only 1/100 of the persons is useless.

Science is not only a matter of doing publications to advance careers.
It has social implications. If an information of high quality is
available on the Net, it will greatly advance the cause of nature
conservation. It will also advance the cause of descriptive biology and
field biology, and help to raise funds (which go to molecular biology
mainly). The paradox is that there is a growing sympathy in the general
public for ecology, nature conservation, biodiversity, etc. But at the
same time there is growing ignorance in Natural History. However there
is a hunger to learn and understand that isn't satisfied by books. But
the answers aren't at hand. With current floras and descriptions
properly computerized, with the web, and some logic programming and
image pattern recognition, we can remedy that.

It seems that descriptive biology needs help from computer scientists,
not only database and knowledge management, but also image processing
(see other posts about "Types of data").

More on those matters at http://jmvanel.free.fr/ .

Thanks for your talk about XML. I have several questions:

o Are Vocabulary and Namespace synonymous terms?

o What is XML-DATA?

o Reading about RDF and Dublin Core as RDF application I was left
confused as to what acutally is a resource. It usually seems to be
assumed that it is a document, but this impression may only be due to
the examples.

Thus, in a file with several item descriptions could:
- Each item be a resource, for which a creator/editor etc. is
described using DublinCore?
- Could even the characters information within an item have different
authors? (And if yes: Is it wise to do this?)
- Is there a limit to a hierarchy of RDF objects in an XML file?

Note: I assume that Mozilla does not apply to Netscape 4.7, which did

I would be very interested in this one.

> o Are Vocabulary and Namespace synonymous terms?

Not quite, and I'd actually say that the term 'vocabulary' might
be a little off base - I'd prefer 'schema' based on the previous
example, and common usage:

A vocabulary (or schema) is the syntax for your XML file. It
defines what are the legal elements and attributes, and how
they can be combined.

A namespace (declaration) indicates that a particular XML
element or attribute belongs to a particular schema (vocabulary).

This means that you can build an XML document based on more
than one schema (vocabulary) and qualify the elements/attributes
to denote which schema they derive from. This is obviously useful
if two schema have elements/attributes of the same name - you
can explicitly state which version you are using.

XML-DATA is one of many proposed schema languages which includes
XML Schemas, SOX and DSD. I'd suggest that XML Schemas is
likely to become the standard simply because its further along
the review process.

As are a lot of XML developers! Its hoped that the next version

Personally I think that morpho-anatomical characters are not
sufficiently different from other character like those mentioned in
Stuarts post. I would want to discuss them here as well.

Interesting things may, however, happen regarding character types.
Besides an expanded list of character types (including date/time,
ordered categorical: linear, cyclic, tree, or complex/reticulate) new
types may appear.

A new type that I am specially interested in, is the "alignment"
type. A while ago on DELTA-L somebody commented that alignments can
principally be treated as a group of categorical characters, just as
they are in NEXUS. However, I believe this treatment is not adequate
for the following reasons:

o the homology of these characters is dependend on the alignment,
  especially:
o adding new items (sequences) may change the homology assumptions
  within the remaining sequences
o the naming/identification of characters would be extremely
  difficult to handle, because a base position depends on the
  alignment

I believe that these special considerations require a special
character type for aligned sequence data

---

What other character types do you think are necessary?

---

Whether images/audio/video material etc. should be considered
character, I am doubtful. I currently prefer to summarize them
together with formatted text documents and database access
(information systems/Identification or query interfaces) or any other
URLs as "external resources". I am not as clear about this as I would
wish. One criterium could be that analytically accessible, well
structured information should be considered a character (thus
including restricted vocabulary text information, e.g. "lists")
whereas only human usable resources should be treated different.

Vector graphics lie somewhere in between... I appreciated the recent
contributions about the parameterizations of shapes, I think this
will be helpful!

I'd agree here. From the examples I've seen of DELTA files, using
characters (or at least their syntax) to describe images is just
a convenience - they're not naturally part of the model.

images/audio/video are supporting resources and certainly wouldn't
be embedded within the format (although this is possible). I could
envisage an audio clip being useful in identifying an item, but
a textual description to accompany the resource ought to be a requirement.

This means that anyone using the format 'offline' doesn't need to
access some resource storage (i.e. the net) to make a successful
identification.

Yes, rendering a graphical representation of (say) a leaf onto the screen
would be a good application for vector graphics. However again some
additional
text describing the image/shape would be useful - for those applications
that don't support vector graphics, or indeed visually impaired users.

In the separate post "Markup of text descriptions Vs. structured data
(GEN)" I suggested that we need to distinguish between markup and
data.

Markup would be:

<leaf>leaves usually obovate, 3 cm long</leaf>

or

<leaf>leaves usually <shape>obovate</shape>, <length>3 cm<length>
long</leaf>


Don suggested to encode the data element like:

<leaf shape="obovate" length_mm="31"/>

     (NB: Please read the hardcoded namespace as an example only, see
          my separate "(GEN) Schema independence" post)

As far as I understand XML, these attributes would be automatically
hidden from view, which is fine for the markup purpose. However, I
would prefer a coding method, which would allow comprehensive use of
XML for the data definition part as well.

Probably a stylesheet could determine whether only the free text with
hidden markup is visible, only the data, or both?

Any ideas, perhaps any technical suggestions, how to achieve that?

Exactly (says a mycologist). Also, what about at least 20 different
name spaces for protists, 50 or so for bacteria. Viruses, mycoplasms,
viroids, ...

Biological diversity is well beyond our current grasp. We should
admit that we do NOT understand it in any way sufficiently. Even what
we understand is obscured by terminoly inadequacies or concurrent,
but not entirely synonymous terminology. From my own experience, I
think that unifying character definition even among fairly closely
related groups of a small group of the fungi can be a challenging
task.

Richard Pankhurst could probably step in here and explain why it is
so difficult to even draw up a core consensus character set for all
higher plants (an effort he is concerned with for several years now).

The tendency in this discussion to assume that things like leaf,
petiole, veins etc. should be directly coded into the standard
worries me. The examples are fine for the purpose of discussion, but
I hope that most people agree that the schema independence of DELTA
(and principally also NEXUS, although NEXUS leaves most of the
definition to free text in a published article) is a big achievement,
and I would not like to sacrifice it.

This does not mean that we should not try to unify character schemas,
but it definitely should be a separate task. We need a general
standard, and an applied standard that acutally uses a defined
namespace.

So, I believe we need:

o Character schema definition language, expressed in XML-DTD or
  better XML-Schema
   - Researchers working on weird stuff like Tardigrada should not be
     required to wait until somebody creates a schema for them, but
     must go ahead and develop their own schema.
   - DELTA is, in part, such a language.

o Character schema (an applied character definition, that acutally
  defines names, type, constraints, etc. for a set of characters),
  expressed in the new Character schema definition language.
   - The character definition of a DELTA data set is such a schema.
   - The thing to achieve would be, to express this in such a way
     that it becomes a usable XML Namespace definition, while still
     linking into the Character schema definition language! I could
     then be directly used by XML tools, but it would be developed
     with added value by the more relevant additional definition in
     the Character schema definition language!
o An application to express item descriptions using these tools.
  - Example: DELTA ITEM DESCRIPTION.

Thus I envision something like:

+ Character definition language,
    adding special metainformation to:
+ Standard XML Namespace definition,
    which, however, can be used independently

Both together form a character schema of a new standard, which would
be used in item descriptions. The item descriptions themselves have
two components:

+ A markup language to mark existing (or computer generated) free
  textual descriptions
+ A data language, to exactly define the data used, including
  knowledge management support

structured data (GEN)"

Jean-Marc Varel, Don Kirkup and others have repeatedly touched the
problem of existing textual descriptions in their discussions
contributed to this list.

On the other hand, I myself belong to the group of DELTA/NEXUS minded
people, who are concerned mostly with knowledge management of
descriptive data that are created new.

These issues should be seen quite separately, and that we need both

1. A markup language for text documents. This includes:
  - existing descriptions, captured by OCR or other means, where the
    markup would be manually (or automated/data mining?)
  - computer generated natural language descriptions that are
    published as electronic documents. A new CSIRO package could have
    a ToNat command that automatically adds the necessary, hidden
    markup code.
2. A data language for new observations, including repeated
   measurements or repeated observations of categorical data, e.g.
   shape of multiple leaves in a single specimen. Further, many
   structures for knowledge managements (data revision, annotation,
   quality control and assessment) need to be implemented here.

The issues overlap, and it would be beneficial to use as much common
syntax as possible, but fundamentally I believe them to be quite
different.

See also the separate post "Item description data in XML (XML)" for
discussion of how to achieve this in XML and with XML examples.

My use of "external resource" was rather unclear. I am thinking in
terms of a database information system, so external resource means
any URL or file based document. Thus external in my use could just as
well be a local resource as a internet resource. If an information
system is distributed on CD, all images, formatted text, and audio
etc. would be on that CD.

Any better terms than "external resource"? I don't like media
resource/hypermedia etc., because I feel this is not very adequate
for resources like a query/identification interface.

A resource in my model has specific attributes (which are different
from characters), esp. indication of scope (to which
items/character/state it belongs + flags whether it is to be used as
default resource for this scope), a caption, which contains the
description, media types, etc.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'hidden from view' - do you mean when
rendered into a web browser? If so then I'd be wary about making assumptions
as to what type of applications will be processing the markup. Using
the DOM and/or SAX programming APIs I can get direct access to the
attributes of an element and then process them just as I could any
other markup.

My XML based application may not render the data at all - it might
just use the data to perform some other functionality - lets not
get too fixed up on the visual representation.

> Probably a stylesheet could determine whether only the free text with

Again, apologies if I mis-read your intent...

An XSL stylesheet defines how to render an XML document into 'Formatting
Objects' which are then handled by the renderer as it requires. One
such renderer may be a web browser. Another might be a PDF document
generator.

XSL is based on XSLT which is a means of taking an XML document
and producing another document from it (not necessarily XML).
XSLT currently supports three output methods - XML, plain-text
and HTML. XSLT is commonly used to take XML and render it into
HTML for the web - useful because there is limited support
for XML in browsers. IE5.0 for example has an XSL implementation
which is out of date, and Netscape lacks one at all.

Now to go back to your question - how the XML is handled depends
on the application. One application might be generating plain-text
descriptions of the data, or indeed backwards compatible
files (I give an XSLT stylesheet for generating DELTA character
files from XDELTA files at : http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ccslrd/delta/)

Another application might render the XML directly into a browser,
and might use another suitable stylesheet. So the first thing
to note is that your stylesheet is going to be determined
by what kind of output you're expecting - I wouldn't expect
a 'default' stylesheet at all. Instead there will be
different stylesheets for different contexts (web browser,
PDF, plain-text, etc, etc).

Secondly I might not be generating anything visible at all. I can
well imagine an application that will take an XML document and
from the data within produce (say) a taxonomic tree or tress of that
data. Here I wouldn't use a stylesheet, I'd simply process the
data directly.

Let me know if I can provide any more info on the above.

Cheers,

L.

XSLT, now an official W3 Recommendation, is the language for
transforming XML documents into other XML documents. From the point of
view of XSLT, document nodes include text, XML elements, element
attributes, comments, and a few other things. This makes it
particularly easy to hide or reveal either the text or the markup, or
the attributes in various combinations.

Gregor

Can you explain in more detail why they should be fundamentally different?
Aren't the differences just a matter a matter of degree, different points
on a continuum of data as it were?  And aren't the basic principles
applicable across the whole?

Is not the issue we are dealing with here one of how to deal with
biological descriptive information whether at the level of individual
components of the specimen (e.g. each of the leaves), the specimen as a
whole (e.g. the variation of leaves on a specimen) or the taxon (e.g. the
variation of leaves across all specimens of the species, or the higher
level taxon)?  Or at any other level, or mixture of levels, we might chose?

Is it not possible, and indeed preferrable, to have a single scheme that
covers all of these situations?

I am finding it a bit difficult to get a grip of this discussion and where
it is going (or where it is coming from, for that matter).  I thought I
understood (and agree with) your previous post about the need for a
definition component as distinct from the the description and data in the
same manner as the DTDs of SGML, but I am now not so sure if that is what,
or all of what, is being suggested.

Hello

Gregor Hagedorn a écrit :

> o Are Vocabulary and Namespace synonymous terms?

Here is quotation from http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-schema
(W3C's RDF schema spec.)

4.1.1. Terminology
The phrase 'RDF vocabulary' is used here to refer to those resources which
evolve over time; 'RDF schema' is used to denote those resources which
constitute the particular (unchanging) versions of an RDF vocabulary at any
point in time. Thus we might talk about the evolution of the Dublin Core
vocabulary. Each version of the Dublin Core vocabulary would be a different
RDF schema, and would have a corresponding RDF model and concrete syntactic
representation.

It's a W3C Note of 1998 by Microsoft and others, that is to a large extent
implemented in IE5 (but under the name of XML Schema). W3C's "true" XML
Schema, still a Working draft, is not very different from XML-DATA.

Here is a quotation from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax
(W3C's RDF spec.)
Resources
All things being described by RDF expressions are called resources. A
resource may be an entire Web page; such as the HTML document
"http://www.w3.org/Overview.html" for example. A resource may be a part of
a Web page; e.g. a specific HTML or XML element within the document source.
A resource may also be a whole collection of pages; e.g. an entire Web
site. A resource may also be an object that is not directly accessible via
the Web; e.g. a printed book. Resources are always named by URIs plus
optional anchor ids (see [URI]). Anything can have a URI; the extensibility
of URIs allows the introduction of identifiers for any entity imaginable.

So we can have an URI for a plant species.

The Dublin Core is a particular vocabulary in that it has only properties;
other vocabularies, like RDF schema mentioned above have properties and
types.

See also my recent post about asserting in RDF a butterfly being a plant's
pollinizator.

One last remark: Dublin Core is a much publicized vocabulary, but it's
simple with only 15 properties. A botanical vocabulary will count hundreds
of properties (from both organs and features).

Yes and yes. An article can have an author, and have quotations from others

OK, warten Sie mal... Ich muss das überlegen.

Just say for the moment that we'll have several vocabularies by large
domains:

   * biological descriptions (generalities)
   * botany
   * zoology
   * Virology
   * Microbiology
   * geography
   * ecology

May the forgoten disciplins forgive me... They'll have their XML
vocabularies too.

Just to comment here, one approach being taken by the XHTML working group
is to take modular approach with future version of the specification (XHTML
1.1.
onwards). This allows defined portions of the spec to be replaced with
vendor specific extensions, e.g. replace all the form elements with
some extended/amended syntax, or the same with tables, etc.

Such an approach might benefit this effort, in that a core set of
descriptive markup for characters can be defined, and then allow
additional modular extensions for the differing disciplines.

This has the advantage of providing a small initial spec and data model
which can then be extended. (an approach thats worth considering
even without modularity included in the final design).

Thanks for the insight into XSL and XSLT. I think I understand the
context much better now; I was really thinking in terms of
stylesheets alone.

The problem is really that I believe using XML is a good idea because
it allows reuse of existing tools, but then I really don't have any
experience with an existing tools other than IE5, which does not do
much. That in principal it is always possible (and necessary) to
write custom applications for custom functionality is quite
understood.

However, it would be nice to have generally accepted mechanisms, that
allow to use certain feature right out of the box.

When I was asking about how to manage free text with markup and data
_efficiently_, I was thinking about how to use standard tools (which
don't exist that much yet) to edit the different views of the data,
much more than thinking about reporting/screen display with a
stylesheet.

---

Also, I think I did not do a good job in explaining where I see the
problems (which may be due to my lack of understanding XML). Lets go
back to examples. Markup of the text:

   leaves usually obovate (except in young leaves), 3 cm long

could look like

  <leaf>leaves
     <shape>
        <frequency modifier>usually</frequency modifier>
        <categorical value>obovate</categorical value>
        <reportable note>(except in young leaves)</reportable note>
     </shape>
     ,
    <length>3 cm<length>
    long
  </leaf>

Thats already quite complicated. But how do I add the data?
The data contain, e.g. an identifier for obovate (i.e. an
alphanumeric code or some GUID) to identify the term obovate in
relation to some character schema. Note that the character schema may
use the term obovate as identifier, so it could be identical.
However, German, Chinese, or Russion descriptions will have quite
other text within the markup...

Further the data would contain more detailed information what
frequency "usually" really is, where the original information has
been stored, it may contain in addition to the 3 cm information
whether "3 cm" is a single measurement, a guess, or the average of 30
measurements, for each of these informations.

Yet another level is the knowlegde management, with authoring,
editing/revision, quality control, multiple annotations etc.

Welding all this into the above structure is quite complicated, so I
am looking for general guidelines, how this can be achieved
efficiently. My feeling is, that attributes within elements are not
the solution, but I may be wrong. In Don's example

<leaf shape="obovate" length_mm="31"/>

It is difficult to add information about obovate or length. Noel
already noted that we may be running into this "properties of
properties" problem.

General question: Is there any reason why attributes exist at all?
What is the advantage of

<leaf shape="obovate" length_mm="31"/>

over

<leaf>
 <shape>obovate</shape>
 <length>31</length>
 <MeasurementUnit>mm</MeasurementUnit>="
</leaf>

?

I completely agree with you that the issues overlap and should be treated
together. However, I still see them a distinct, so that they can be
treated by separate groups of commands, that use a common system.
But maybe that is only to try to protect my brain from blowing up in
confusion :-)

Could you perhaps give examples where you see the continuum?
My differences (see also the example in the other post) are:
o Language in free text that is marked up may have different
  language, while the underlying data should be language independent
o Similarly, on a more subtle level, the concepts used by one authors
  may only approximately map unto the concepts developed in the
  character definition
o Data may be more detailed, which unambigously may map unto a course
  natural language representation
o Much additional knowledge management attributes, mutliple
  authoring/editing/revision layers, annotation and assessment,
  quality control, status regarding data source and passing
  information up and down taxonomic hierarchy, assumptions about
  possible misinterpretations, etc.

Much information may be used for markup as well as for data, so there
will be overlap. However, for example, for a given character
definition multiple independent hierarchical classifications (by
morphological structure, perhaps according to different schools, by
methods, by function) may be defined; the natural language definition
will however usually only use a single classification. This
classification is superfluous in the item description part of the
data, but it is desirable to add to the markup. Or isn't it? But then
we could not use the idea to just use a coarse structure-only markup
as a first step to limit the scope of XML queries, an idea forwarded
by Don Kirkup and Bryan Heidorn at the TDWG meeting.

In general a tag can provide the same function as an attribute, as in the
case you mention, but there are some situations where attributes are
useful.  For example, in cases where text is being marked up and the text
itself cannot be altered, new data can be stored in attributes.

In this case country IDs can  added without altering the text:

   "They can be found in <country id="EN">England</country> and in
   <country id="IT">Italy</country>."

Also in cases where you don't want your tagged items to be rendered by a
browser. For example, if you add some RDF metadata:

  <rdf:RDF>
    <rdf:Description about="http://www.veggies.org/carrot.jpg">
      <s:Family>Apiaceae</s:Family>
    </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>

The this case the word "Apiaceae" would be rendered in the page,
while in this case:

  <rdf:RDF>
    <rdf:Description about="http://www.veggies.org/carrot.jpg"
         s:Family="Apiaceae"
  </rdf:RDF>

the word "Apiaceae" would not appear in the page.

There are probably more fundamental differences that Liegh, Bob, and
others could come up with -- these are just two that come to mind.

Best,
-Noel

Popular wisdom often asserts there is no difference, but there are
important differences for database work which are less so (except 1
below) for documents (hence the popular wisdom). These things are true
of attributes in XML but not necessarily of elements (the tags + stuff
between them) depending on the grammar defining the vocabulary:

1. Attributes are order independent

2. There can only be one attribute,value pair for each attribute.

3. With DTD's (which are the wrong thing to consider here but
that is another story), you can enumerate the permitted values of
attributes. You can work around this for elements but it may be
pointless, verbose, and fragile, especially because of the order
dependence of elements.

4. (Subtle and technical)References to XML objects essentially must appear as
attributes. This is the only way you can get non-tree graph structure
in XML documents, and also is the way you would make a data value
conveniently be another object. So if "obvate" were actually some
complex object that held more information, you would probably find it
named as the value of an "idref", not as text data.
While specimen and species documents may prove to representable by
trees, keys probably will not be.

Robin Cover covers some of the issues here:

http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/elementsAndAttrs.html

This debate is also currently raging on the XML-DEV mailing list. There
are proponents for both sides of the debate, which can get
quite heated!

If you care to dip in you can look at the thread here:

http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev/xml-dev-Nov-1999/0998.html

There are strong arguments on either side - even the
'attributes are required for linking' viewpoint isn't firm,
as

<leaf shape="obovate" />

<leaf>
  <shape>obovate</shape>
</leaf>

are semantically identical. It largely depends on which you
prefer, and how your schema is defined. The id/idref linking
mechanism only works within documents. Its unlikely that this
will apply in this context as links will be likely *between*
documents - and we'll therefore be using XPointers (which are
based on XPath).

Its up to the application to decide whether it looks for
a shape attribute or element.

Cheers,

L.

Hello

We are designing XML vocabularies for the description of biological
species.
See :
http://jmvanel.free.fr
and Taxonomic Databases Working Group - Structure of Descriptive Data
<TDWG-SDD@USOBI.ORG> (mailing list)
archive available at http://usobi.org/archives/tdwg-sdd.html

This is a large project: 250 000 species of plants, 1 000 000 of
insects, relations beetwen plants and insects, etc...


There is a containment hierarchy (e. g. a flower contains petals) which
raises no problems in XML.

But there is an inheritance hierarchy that I don't know how to handle
using W3C's specifications alone.
A genus has properties values (e. g. flower/petals/color = 'white' )
that MUST be inherited by the species in this genus. The properties
values of a genus CAN be overriden by some species in this
genus.

It seems that the "refines" property in XML Schema would bring the
desired semantics, together with the "Schema Information Set
Contribution: augmentations to instance information sets which follow as

a consequence of schema-validation". But the uncomplete state of the W3C
document makes me unshure.

Although RDF and RDF Schema's data model are very promising, allowing to
:
- make links between plants and insects,
- state properties about properties (some are morphological, others are
chemical, etc ...) ,

I don't see anything clearly specified in RDF and RDF Schema for
inheritance of properties.

Would this be a solution:
- each instance of genus is a rdfs:Class, e.g. all daisies belong to
(are rdfs:subClassOf) the genus Chrysantemum;
- a genus has Class properties,
- a species, instance of species, and subClassOf a genus, redefines some
of the genus' properties, overrides the other properties, and adds
properties unspecified by the genus.

Sample RDFS:

<rdfs:Class ID="Chrysantemum"/>
   <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http:botany.org/taxonomy#genus"/>
   <flower><petals>
    <color>white</color>
    <number>10--40</number>
  </petals></flower>
</rdfs:Class>

<species>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="Chrysantemum" />

Hmm, I'm not 100% sure either, but my feeling is that RDF is better
suited to this task than Schema.

As I understand things - we're looking to produce a generic schema for
capturing character data. In this case, "refines" could be used to extend
the schema to include attributes/elements from other disciplines.

RDF allows you to describe 'resources' independent of the structure
of the schema they conform to, and allows things like sub-classing.

> I don't see anything clearly specified in RDF and RDF Schema for

>From the RDF Schema spec : http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-schema/

"Classes themselves are often organised in a hierarchical fashion,
for example the class 'dog' might be considered a sub-class of 'animal'
which is a sub-class of 'organism' etc., meaning that any resource which is
of rdf:type 'dog' is ipso facto also of rdf:type 'animal' and so on. This
specification describes a property, rdfs:subClassOf, to denote such
relationships
between classes."

...and (describing subClassOf)...

"If class A is a sub-class of some broader class B, and B is a sub-class of
C,
then A is also implicitly a sub-class of C. Consequently, resources that are
instances of class A will also be instances of C, since A is a sub-set of
both B and C"

...and (describing subPropertyOf)...

"If the property biologicalFather is a sub-property of the broader
property biologicalParent, and if Fred is the biologicalFather of John, then
it is implied that Fred is also the biologicalParent of John."

I think these portions of the spec apply to the sort of 'inheritance' you
require - or am I missing a subtle difference here? If you wish to
provide default values for properties then I think this needs to be
addressed at an application level.

> Info. for computer men: biology has a hierarchic classification of

Heres an RDF example of this structure (I've kept it to the
lower 4 levels of the classification, ignoring Kingdom, Phylum, Class,
etc.).

<rdf:Description ID="Order">
<rdf:type
resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#Class"/>
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.foo.com/taxonomy-schema#Class"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description ID="Family">
<rdf:type
resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#Class"/>
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Order"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description ID="Genus">
<rdf:type
resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#Class"/>
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Family"/>
</rdf:Description>

<rdf:Description ID="Species">
<rdf:type
resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#Class"/>
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Genus"/>
</rdf:Description>

Here we can declare Chrysanthemum to be a subclass of species, forgive
me for not knowing the latin name...

<rdf:Description ID="Chrysanthemum">
<rdf:type
resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#Class"/>
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Species" />
</rdf:Description>

However, and this is where I'm still wrestling with RDF to an extent,
there are other ways to achieve this. For example, we may not need Genus and
Species
classes - instead modelling the Chrysanthemum genus as a class, and species
as subclasses.
Note that RDF does allow a resource to be a subclass of more than one class.

I can see a lot of work ahead in this area, and there seems to be a wealth
of
different ways to model the same ideas. I'm at present digging through the
literature to come up with some decent examples. (I hope the above was
vaguely
useful).

I would like to challenge this assumption, which seems to be
generally accepted in the discussion here.

It is true: Morphological structures may have containment
hierarchies, but I believe that these depent strongly on the
viewpoint of the author or user.

EXAMPLE 1: The peduncle (stalk of a flower) is usually assumed to be
part of the flower, but anatomically it is clearly a part of the stem
(in contrast to the petiole, stalk of a leaf!).

EXAMPLE 2: Stuff can be in-between: The inflorescence contains part
of stem, part of leaves, and all flowers. Which leaves are part of
inflorescens and thus called bracts, and which aren't is often a
matter of taste, school, country...

Thus: there are multiple concurrent or competing hierarchies, which
may overlap.

EXAMPLE 3: Further, other, non-morphological
hierarchies/classifications exist. These may be much more relevant
for many purposes, and may be the primary outline used in a natural
language description. For example, structures can be classified by
function (sexual/asexual propagation), observation method (naked
eye/light microsc./electron microscopy, physiological/molecular etc.

EXAMPLE 3 (leaving morphology altogether): Gene sequences can be
classified as transscribed/non-transscribed, Protein-coding/rRNA
coding/non-coding, intron/exon, regulatory/structural,
conserved/variable/hypervariable etc. Most of these classifications
overlap.

*** Call for more examples: Can anybody come up with more good
examples (perhaps from animals) as to why a fixed hierarchy in the
form of a feature path may be unpractical?

I have no insight on the way it would be handled in XML, but I
believe we must consider that (a) inheritance goes up and down, and
(b) information may be original or virtual.

The genus description is nothing more than the consensus description
of all species placed in that genus. This is true regardless, whether
it is done by computer or a scientist. The type species (the species
to which the genus name is bound) will carry more wheight, some
people may wheigh it very strongly.

Thus
             currently placed in GenusX
Species1=101 \
Species2=10U  > synthesized ("summary function") description of GenusX
Species3=10U /

results in a description GenusX=[101)
(1 = a state applies, 0 = does not apply, U = unknown, not yet
observed)

Some information, e.g. anatomical or electron microscopy is usually
only obtained from one or few species and then assumed to be true for
all species in the Genus. Thus, information that was passed up, is
now passed down again to species where this has not been studied.
Care must be taken that the information is recognized as being passed
down, it can NOT be simply copied as if it would indeed have been
studied there.

Species1=10 1
Species2=10[1]
Species3=10[1]

Square brackets shall here indicate that the information has been
passed down.

It will often happen that Species3 is transferred to a different
Genus, because the assumption that it belongs to GenusX turned out to
be false. The GenusX description must now be revised, and information
that was passed up from Species3 to GenusX and down to Species1/2
must be removed.

This is a continous dynamic process in science, and must be modeled
on the computer.

However, the Genus description is not necessarily entirely dynamic.
In many cases it will be necessary to copy information from
publication, thus the Genus description may be physical and original
data, in contrast to the virtual descriptions obtained by automatic
synthesis processes.

Getting messy - I can't imagine that there's much shared vocabulary between,
say, mammals, insects, nematodes, sponges..., just to take a few groups from
the "zoology vocabulary". And if you asked taxomomists in each of these
fields to use a common vocab they'd complain about square pegs in round holes.

I think this whole idea of a universalist vocabulary (even several
universes) is becoming silly. Better to work on the generalities and let
collaborators work up their own vocabularies, with all the mess that that
will entail. If this thing ever takes off, I think there will be no way of
avoiding hundreds of vocabularies, not any handful that we can determine.

Even a core set for mammals, insects, nematodes, sponges... would probably
be a null set, except for cellular characters.

We need to explore this a lot more.

I'm talking here about the data language, not the markup language, as it
seems to me there are practical, even if not theoretical, differences.

I can well understand the benefit from marking up a document (a text
description) in XML. But when it comes to straight data, I'm less sure.

By straight data, I mean data that can be represented most concisely as a
matrix, for instance:

Characters:
Leaves
 ovate
 elliptic
Flowers
 blue
 yellow
Taxa:
 taxon1
 taxon2
Data (taxa x states):
0101
1010

(...or a DELTA type disaggregated matrix)

With this type of data, the XML markup becomes considerably more verbose
than the data. Is this a problem?

Over the past couple of days I've partially implemented an export function
to produce Leigh's XDELTA documents (as a simple example of a possible XML
format) for the data in Lucid keys. I have a key to families of flowering
plants of Australia (240 taxa, 166 characters, 600 states). The data I'm
using are simple - basically a score matrix, a list of taxa and a list of
characters. The file sizes in three formats for these data are:

LucID    166 kb
DELTA    240 kb
XML      c3  Mb

And this is only the most basic XML!.

Now, perhaps in a few years we'll be carrying terabytes of data in our back
pockets, but I would have thought that file size is important, particularly
if I'm using this as an interchange format and want to email the data to
someone (the xml file compresses very well into a zipfile, it's true).

The following question:

what could we do with such data as XML that we couldn't do with the data as
a simple structured file as above?

Leigh wrote:

Is direct processing of XML data any easier than direct processing of the
data in a simpler format? Perhaps there will be off-the-shelf parsing tools,
but how much of a benefit will this be?

The problem to my mind is that in current formats, e.g. DELTA and LucID,
much information is implied by context. Thus, in

1010
0101

The taxa and character state numbers (identities) are implied by the
position of the data bit in the matrix. In XML this information is verbosely
explicit.

Is the following true?: once upon a time, computers could represent but not
efficiently analyse or process textual data, hence documents were stored as
text but "data" were stored as matrices etc. Now, XML has blurred the
boundary between these types of information ("textual" and "data") and we're
exploring the implications of that blurring. But are there now no
differences, and no further need for a matrix?

A final point. It seems to me that the discussion so far has been dominated
by computer nuts (no offence intended, we need you!), with relatively little
input from the community of taxonomists whose needs this standard is
supposed to serve. Most of these will be happy to use a well-crafted tool,
but won't want to know the intricacies of XML, and will be put off if things
are not quite straightforward. This is a danger. We may end up with a
wonderful, sophisticated, state-of-the-art, cutting-edge standard that
nobody uses.

I believe the point was that we need to plan for a mechanism to handle
consistently and with reasonable efficiency a wide variety of vocabularies in an
extensible format, not that we would actually mandate any universal format.  Any
recommendation once implemented will, however, necessarily require us to forego
some possible schemes.  Lets just be sure that useful ideas are not lost as we
collectively thrash things out.

> Leigh comments:

>

The fact that not every pair of taxa can be compared for a particular basis of
comparison doesn't mean establishing a number of "vocabularies/name spaces" for
particular levels of generality is a useless approach.  Considering that such a
common set or "core or intersection" might actually be several thousands of
"protein" characters alone might suggest that this might be more fruitful than
one might first suspect.  I would agree, however, that it will likely take a
potentially large number of "namespaces" to tease out all the
interesting/potentially informative features in comparing widely disparate taxa,
especially since one would like to characterize features along more than one
basis of comparison (eg biochemical as well as morphological or ecological).  We
need not settle on a "final solution" as to name useage here, but only develop a
mechanism that can be modified through time, according to conventional useage, so
as to encompass a wide array of complex associations, some not yet discovered.

If I have at least partially correctly digested the references on the RDF syntax
correctly, we seem to need a mechanism to handle a wide variety of
subject,predicate,object relations relating to both taxa and characters.  The
extent of these statments will likely arrange themselves according to the context
(taxa) in question, at least to a large degree.  Consequently it seems to me that
we need some mechanism to specify taxa as a qualifier, or at least the "taxonomic
range" (extent) over which the basis of comparison (character) implies.
Likewise, we also need some mechanism (set of name spaces?) for communicating the
basis(bases) of comparison implict for a given character (ie shape, molecular
structure, fine structure, gross morphology, scale of comparison, physiology,
etc.).

>From my perspective, for statements of the form Taxon "A" HAS character "X", it
would seem we need distinct "name spaces" (if my present conception of this term
is the one being used by XML programmers) for both the taxa (subject) and
character (object) part of the dialog.  It remains unclear to me if this implies
whether we may also need a potentially separate set of "name-spaces" for the
reverse mappings (of the form character "X" can be found in/identified in/is
representative of Taxon "A").   My suspicion is that we do, since such relations
will usually not be isomorphic.  However, this may depend upon the discipline
(context).  Likewise,  the nature of the qualifiers for the predicates themselves
(such as "is found in", "has", "has many of", "is a protein of", "has the shape
of", "is a synapomorphy for" etc.)  are even more unclear to me, as is  whether
there are any universal or common rules regarding such predicates that might
usefully constrain the ways the taxon and character "vocabularies" are defined
and used as an XML "grammar" potentially emerges.  Also, it is also not yet clear
to me how we can use XML to construct more complicated grammars implicit in the
higher order grammatical relations of the type "Taxon "A" has character "X"
according to Investigator(s) "Y" using observational method "Z" at time "T" (for
rapidly evolving retroviruses or seaonal breeding colors, flowering condition. or
molecular pathways perhaps).

With respect to "messy" names-spaces/vocabularies I suggest we let the computers
handle the large lists, multiple spellings, homonymy of terms, etc. They are
particularly good at it and we will need a great many to characterize the
millions of taxa, billions of molecules, and innumerable different bases for
character definitions.  I believe we need to concern ourselves more with how a
consistent grammar for a "metadata language about characters and taxa" can be
constructed/(implemented on the WWW) to facilitate consistent human input and
precise meaning.  Which specific character strings we ultimately use to formulate
the tags or namespaces might take a bit longer to resolve, particularly should
foreign colleagues feel strongly that they should be given unicode rather than
soley ascii representations.

Here's my example:

In ferns, leaves are often highly divided, into pinnae, pinnules, segments
and even lower order elements. In most descriptions, a clear hierarchy is
implied: pinnae are part of leaf, and inherit the properties, pinnules are
part of pinnae and inherit...

Programmers may be tempted to hard-code this hierarchy.

However, for many characters, an opposite hierarchy can be devised, which
may be much more informative: ultimate segments have margin, veins, and
properties of those, which are inherited in the penultimate elements, and
then onwards to the leaf. Especially in species where degree of dissection
varies strongly (they occur), this may be a much better way of descibing a
fern leaf.
Hard-coding the usual hierarchy of leaf, pinnae, pinnules may therefore
stand in the way of understanding and describing fern morphology.

Is that clear enough for non-fern people?

Programmers who hard-code /anything/ should be sent back to school for
re-education.

Not only should software itself behave according to the principle of
least amazement, but we know that this is best accomplished if the
programmers never build in assumptions about how the clients will use
the software or present the data.


The biggest advantage of XML for this group is its impending ubiquity,
not its formal structure, and (in my opinion) the discussion here
should return to discussing problems, not solutions because that
ubiquity will make the community want to use it whether it is the best
fit or not (just as has happened with HTML as a presentation vehicle).

I am reminded of a talk I heard from a high-level member of the
technical staff at Adobe a few years ago about an
aborted three-year language development project. By his cleverly
crafted presentation it became clearer and clearer to the audience
that this new language had exactly the design features of another,
just recently released language, he finally ended his talk by saying:
"As we prepared to take the cloak off this project, we stepped into
the street, looked up and saw that we were in the path of a huge,
oncoming train. Its name was Java. We scrapped the project."

By comparing three different encodings of a particular data set, I think
that Kevin has given us a very graphic demonstration of the potential
verbosity of an XML specification for descriptive data.  This is
definitely a syntactic issues that we'll need to address, even as we
try to characterize the semantics of what it is that we need to encode.

For this reason, I would suggest that examples giving in XML should not
imply that we'll end up actually using XML as the recommended syntactic
encoding of descriptive data, and that indeed no decision has been made
on this matter.

Shearing files between programs without data loss

Several users have reported problems of data loss when passing files
between programs. With XML and the Document Object Model, this will
never happen, because it's easy for a programmer to work on the document
tree, just adding nodes where additions have been made by user, and
leaving the other parts unchanged. So a round-trip beetwen programs will
be feasible, leading to a composite document having a common core of
elements understood by both programs, some elements understood by
program A only, and some by program B only.

Cheers

My synthetic answer to Kevin Thiele's question:

Why XML?

   * it is the ultimate standard for exchange of data of any kind: textual,
     database, knowledge representation, etc; this standard is quickly growing
     and there is no doubt it will succeed, accompanying the growth of Internet;
   * it is extendible, allowing to be very formal or very unformal, as needed,
   * lots of free tools and standards exist for parsing, viewing, transforming,
     querying,
   * it is possible to apply the same techniques on the client browser or on the
     server, thus adding flexibility.

See the main links on XML on http://jmvanel.free.fr/XML.htm


And now the figures about the "verbosity" of XML:

My XML example (a single plant species from the flora of China) compresses from
2500 bytes to 1090 (57%):
http://jmvanel.free.fr/Samples/DisplayDescriptions/species_example.xml

An Xdelta example (Lepidoptera) on Leigh Dodds' site
compresses from 50500 bytes to 3600 (93%), because it has a large number of
repeted tags.

I used winzip.

Now we see that we can have all plant species on a CD (650 Mb), even without
compression:
2500 bytes * 250 000 species = 625 Mb

And on a DVD you can have 10 times more! And also on Internet with the new HTTP
1.1 protocol, the files can be compressed during transmission. Still 2 more
arguments: the verbose repeted tags are not repeted when the XML file has been
parsed and is in memory; the last argument is financial: today you can buy a 10
000 Mega-bytes disk for 200 US$ , and it will decrease.

So file size is NO problem for taxonomy with XML. You must understand that it's
the small price to pay for extensibility and interoperability.

Agreed. In some cases large file size does present a problem though.

Example 1:  NaviKey is a Java applet that has to do the following:
 - download data
 - parse data
 - interact with user

If the data are uncompressed XML files, then download time is obviously a
major problem. If the XML is compressed, there is still the added time
involved in compressing/uncompressing data, as well as new memory
considerations.

Example 2:  Say I want to run NaviKey on my Palm Pilot*.  The device has
limited resources and I would prefer to use very small files if at all
possible.

As you say, these problems will all go away someday.

Best,

-Noel Cross

*I only wish it were possible -- A few people have actually asked for this
capability, as it would be handy to use such as program in the field.

It's probably not that far off.  I found the program that Larry Morse
first did for interactive specimen identification before I entered Grad
School.  It takes 64K to run.  (At the time it probably had a limit of
64K for data too -- and that stretched the limits of the computer.)  Most
of your hand-help calculators have a memory of at least 64K now.
How programmable *is* a Palm Pilot?

Hi all,

Getting back to requirements, one thing that came up at the TDWG meeting
was what I think of as the character/state/comment issue.

Often, DELTA uses "characters", "states", and "comments" in the following
manner:  (Using XDELTA here instead of DELTA-CLASSIC because to me it's a
bit more clear)

   <character number="8">
      <description>outer edge of front wing</description>
      <comment>shape</comment>
      <multi type="unordered">
         <state number="1">convex</state>
         <state number="2">straight</state>
         <state number="3">concave</state>
         <state number="4">irregular</state>
      </multi>
   </character>

It was pointed out that "shape" is more than just a comment, but a
critical piece of data, a "property", which modifies the character and
perhaps even restricts the states to various types. Mike seemed to
indicate that there would be a way to make this explicit in DELTA, though
I don't recall what the mechanism was.

Should this be explored as a possible requirement? How might this be issue
best be resolved?

Wellcome in this list!

It seems that we are on the same wavelength, see my vision in :
http://jmvanel.free.fr/call.htm

I know little about Palm Pilot. But we should avoid being tied to proprietary systems and API, which doesn't prevent to work on Palm Pilot, having a compatibility API layer for proprietary calls. It seems that a lot can be done a standard browser, using Javascript, DOM, XSLT, with small applets to provide the rest of functionalities. Internet Explorer 5 will probably be soon XSLT-compliant, and Mozilla (www.mozilla.org) is advancing, having a modular, open-source architecture, and support for XML and CSS.

Anax junius, locally known as the Green Darner Dragonfly, was designated
the official insect of the state of Washington in 1997. (See
http://www.americasflowers.com/kids/wakids.html for the other official
symbols of Washington state, including the state bird, the state
fruit, the state fish, and the state folk song).


As of December 4, 1999 there were 14,797 signatures on a petition to
make A. junius the state insect of Michigan
(http://members.aol.com/YESnetwk/Progress.html).

My question: is it uniquely American for a political jursidiction to
have an official insect? And what role does an official insect
actually play, other than to be designated?

By the way, of 124 pages on the web mentioning A. junius, I could only
find two that told me what it might eat for dinner, which is what sent
me looking in the first place.

As a first cut I just transferred everything from DELTA comments into
XDELTA comments, although it was quite obvious that the 'comment'
component of DELTA was overloaded depending on context (a legacy
problem I guess, and one which raises the prospect of 'extensibility'
as a requirement of the new format).

In the above example the character description is discussing the
'shape' property of the 'outer edge of front wing' character. An alternate
possible encoding would have been the 'shape' property of the
'outer edge' property of the 'front wing' character. I'd say that both
are equally valid, just that the latter is normalised to a great
extent.

However there would appear to be some problems with assuming an
morphological bias to the data model - i.e. a butterfly
has wings which have shape... because its hard to draw
the correct distinctions (see Gregors posting on 1/12
entitled Character and item hierarchy). Therefore attempting
to normalise properties might lead to varying and inconsistent
results.

DELTA already allows dependencies between characters - such
that if a specific state has been selected for a character, other
characters are ignored (i.e. no wings, ignore anything to do
with wings). Is there any other dependency relationships that
might be required, or additional information about such a
relationship?

Restricting states to particular options depending on the property
in question (e.g. leaf and/or wing shape) leads back to the
prior discussion on accepted standards for character description.

Defining, and agreeing upon these standard notations/descriptions are a
fundamental part of specifying this new format, and one that isn't
solved simply by deciding to use XML (for example). Its part of the
fundamental design and modelling, and is therefore something
that should be addressed early on.

Cheers,

L.

Would it be possible to see this code, or at least the resulting XML
files? I'd like to put a lengthier example in with the XDELTA
documentation than I currently have.

Note that some of the verbosity in XDELTA (i.e. the length of
the tag names) was derived from the requirement to make the
format as 'readable' as possible. So that it wasn't opaque
to a user how their data was stored, and also potentially
allowing hand-authoring.

> what could we do with such data as XML that we couldn't do with

At the basic data level I'd say nothing. A data format is a data format.
You could put the whole thing into a complicated CSV (comma separated
value) format if you wanted.

Apart from the lauded benefits of interoperability and the other XML
hype, I see one of the big advantages of XML is that because so much
of the information is explicitly tagged you are able to add additional
layers above that of processing the plain data.

For example an RDF application layer might allow one to make inferences
about a data set (or sets) that would be otherwise difficult with
a format that is more context based.

There are also advantages regarding extensibility (and again this is
just a personal view). Take the DELTA comment structure. It includes
all sorts of different information and has been used to encode different
types of information during the lifetime of the format. When it
comes to processing that data the application needs to be much more
aware of this type of legacy usage. Explicitly tagging data mitigates
some of these problems (but not all, XML isn't a magic bullet by any
means).

As a user of an application it wouldn't matter to me whether my data
is in XML or some other format. Until I decide to use another application.
Can it use this format? Will I lose any data? Can my colleague
use my data in his/her application? Has all my data been rendered obsolete
because the latest version of this package has changed the file
format (i.e. the Microsoft Word syndrome). I believe careful application
of XML can help in these cases.

But you're right to question it at this stage - the initial focus
needs to be on design and data modelling...

> A final point. It seems to me that the discussion so far has been
> dominated by computer nuts (no offence intended, we need you!)

...which I hope to be able to help with, as well as providing any
XML and/or programming support. I'm really keen to hear from the
domain experts out there who can provide hard usage facts.

I'll duck back into my shell now! :)

Cheers,

L.

Indeed, so long as the subset of elements shared by the two applications
are handled correctly in both cases. Application A may decide to
encode a date as simply year-month-day. Application B may decide
to encode it as year-month-day-time. Load file from Application B into
Application A and unless you're careful you may lose precision.

Also consider the following:

   <character number="8">
      <description>outer edge of front wing</description>
      <comment>shape</comment>
      <multi type="unordered">
         <state number="1">convex</state>
         <state number="2">straight</state>
         <state number="3">concave</state>
         <state number="4">irregular</state>
      </multi>
   </character>

   <application-B-tag references="8">
      I referred to standard chart X to finally decide on shapes.
   </application-B-tag>

Application A, ignoring the application B specific tag, on request
of the user deletes character 8. Now load the file up into
application B and you've got a problem - you've lost the character
being referenced.

XML does not solve these problems. Although it brings us closer
to a toolkit that does. Data modelling and agreeing on standard
(extension formats) will help to solve these problems.

See http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ccslrd/delta/#adv, particularly
"xml is not a magic bullet" and the references to postings
on the XML-DEV mailing list.

Sorry to pick holes, but I'd hate for XML to be oversold to the
participants on this list. Its important to see beyond the
hype.

I'd say that the DELTA approach - of avoiding domain (i.e. zoology,
virology, etc)
specific notations in the format has worked well. And I think this is
the level that any initial work should be pitched at.

i.e. the data format should encode taxonomic *data* - just as DELTA
does. Any domain specific schema can be layered on top of this, or
include it. Begin with capturing the relevant data just as DELTA does,
and then progress from there.

This comes back to a point I believe I made before: if the current
format(s) meet all the current and future requirements then theres
no need to change things. If they don't then the work needs to
focus on bridging the gap between the shortfall in requirements.

Here's a proposed requirement for data exchange, brought home by one
of Leigh's examples:


<RQT> It should be possible from the data itself, perhaps together
with external resources to which it refers, for software to determine
whether the order matters for any collection of tags in the
data.</RQT>

One answer is "order always matters". That would be regrettable. For
example, being able to detect that some list is unordered can make it
easier to know whether two data streams represent the same
object. (That's probably a deeper desideratum.)

I am sure this question is addressed in most existing formats; I'm
only arguing it needs to be memorialized as a requirement. I emphasize
"for software to determine". I don't admit the case in which "it's in
the spec" is offered as the answer to this question, unless the spec
is something formal, accessible, and the question can be answered
algorithmically from it. (This is an argument for making specs be in
the same syntax as data, but that's a solution, not a
requirement. It's also an argument why all languages but Lisp are
pointless, but I bet I won't get much sympathy for that position
here... :-) ).

The only problem with competing hierarchies is if we are trying to
standardise and resolve the conflicts. If every worker resolves for their
own project what to call bracts, this is not a problem for us.

>From Jean-Marc:

Are we? I thought we were designing a format by which such a vocabulary can
be represented.

For the record, all the current systems (DELTA, LucID, NEXUS etc) enforce
nothing lexically, they merely enforce a particular way of representing
data. Two data sets for similar groups of plants may contain entirely
different characters, or the same characters worded in different ways, or
the same characters resolved into states in different ways, or
(occasionally) identical characters. Comparing and combining datasets
automatically is thus impossible. This seems such a shame, but is it perhaps
unavoidable?

Thus, if we are designing vocabularies, we are going a long way beyond
what's been attempted before.

Personally, I think designing domain-specific vocabularies will never work,
unless the domain is the individual worker or group of collaborating
workers. The popularity of lexicons is the old seductive universalism again.
Great idea, but...

There are two problems. Firstly, there are (broadly) two types of characters
used in descriptions (and keys) - lets call them comparative and diagnostic
characters. Comparative characters are the fairly general ones - e.g. leaf
shape, ovary position - the sorts of characters that one would aim to
describe consistently for all taxa in a monograph. Diagnostic characters are
special characters that are useful for separating two or more taxa (of
course, sometimes fairly general characters are diagnostic, but not always).

A real example of a diagnostic character (from Synaphaea: Proteaceae):

Ovary with an apical ring of translucent glands......S. bifurcata
Ovary without glands.................................S. oulopha

Clearly, no generalised lexicon or name-space will allow for capture of such
diagnostic characters.

BUT, perhaps we can have a standardised representation for the generalised
characters using a lexicon and then use extensibility to allow user-specific
diagnostic characters? To some extent, but perhaps not...:

I will (foolishly) raise a challenge here that any generalised morphological
character that anyone can come up with (in the plant domain) will be
entirely inadequate for capturing data for some groups. For example, the
most straightforward character I can think of is

Leaves
 present
 absent

But, a diagnostic difference between Discaria pubescens and Discaria nitida
(Rhamnaceae) is the degree to which the leaves persist - in both, leaves
tend to be absent in the adult plant, but in D. pubescens they are often
completely absent while in D. nitida there are usually scattered reduced
leaves on younger branchlets. And in Podostemaceae and Utricularia there's
no guarantee that a leaf-like part is a leaf, because the conventional
differentiation of vegetative parts into leaves/stems doesn't hold.

Mother Nature's a tricky old dame, and any character definition will be
inadequate to catch her. But do we put up with the inadequacy for the
advantages that the universality brings? - if it means we constrain our
ability to capture data, then I'd say no.

So, I'd like to suggest that we try to develop a standardised data
representation, but put no constraints on character definitions whatsoever.

OK, I'll clarify what I meant by the following two quotes - there is
a difference, but it may not be clear..

Here I'm refering standard(ised) ways of recording the data that gets
stored in the format - e.g. "leaf shapes will be selected
according to the IAPT plain shape chart", "all dates will be in dd-mmm-yyy
format". To make the data as interoperable as possible agreeing on
standard techniques and measures will help. This is not related to
the definition of the format itself - it just defines how its used.

My main point being that any data format (new or otherwise) isn't
beneficial by itself, unless you know how the data was collected.
If that can rely on standard methods then fine. If not then the method
of collection needs to be expressed.

Here I agree with the points you make below - DELTA and the other formats
work because they don't attempt to enforce anything lexically. Lets pitch
the effort at that level. It would be a mammoth and probably impossible
task to capture all possible data usages.

>From that starting point particular groups can then take that standard
and say "when we're recording leaf shapes they will be selected according to
the IAPT plain shape chart". This is a layer above a standard data format.
Here we're defining its usage. This is where the interoperability problem
(sharing data between groups) will be solved.

As I say, it may not be possible to make bold statements like
"use the IAPT plain shape chart" in every domain, but it may be possible
in some domains, or in parts of some domains.

This is the layer at which the interesting stuff begins, without it
you've just got a file format which happens to look the same for everyone.
With agreed usage guidelines, it becomes possible to share data, and make
the kind of inferences and extrapolations that we're lead to believe
RDF, etc will be able to give us.

> So do we or don't we? Am I misinterpreting these that they seem to say
> opposite things?

Bottom line - I'm talking about two different layers :

- a general format for data capture
- (possibly domain specific) standardised usage guidelines

Does that help?

> The only problem with competing hierarchies is if we are trying to
> standardise and resolve the conflicts. If every worker resolves for their

Exactly - each worker can resolve their own hiearchy. But if a hierarchy
could be agreed between groups then you start to get more use from your
data. However any agreement isn't likely to occur between domains (zoology,
bryology, virology), but possibly within a domain.

Possibly - but the data format doesn't solve that. Its how you use it.

We're in agreement here - I'm just suggesting that while there
are no constraints codified in the standard, they still need to
be expressed (if only in usage guidelines) if you want to be
able to share/exchange data meaningfully.

Hello

Leigh Dodds is absolutely right in is "no silver bullet" message.

What I had in mind is an answer to the problem raised by "Susan B. Farmer"
<sfarmer@GOLDSWORD.COM>

... there was no way to take *this* file back into DELTA.  But more than that;
all of the continuous data in the original file (aka measurements) are now
gone and will have to be added back into the DELTA data set by hand.  :-(
Why not extend the current standards that if there are data types that
their particular application doesn't recognize, they stay around -- just
ignored.


So for the programmer it implies that the DOM model should be kept throughout
the application program, and not be rewriten from scratch when the user pushes
"save".

About Leigh Dodds' example:

   <application-B-tag references="8">
      I referred to standard chart X to finally decide on shapes.
   </application-B-tag>

The 'references' attribute is like a pointer in C, or a foreign key in a
database. The example's application B could have put its tag inside the
concerned <character> element. In this case application A would logically
destroy the comment of B together with with the character. Or another solution
would be for the 'references' attribute to be an IDREF (XML's reference to a
document-unique ID); in this way the DOM implementation would probably forbid
the deletion of the element being referenced.

Kevin brought up the question of advantages of XML. Somewhat belated,
because I have been away for 10 days, here are some comments, trying
to summarize the discussion as I see it.

1. I agree entirely with Noel that the discussions about XML on this
list are intended to _explore_ the advantages of XML, not to settle
on it. XML is well defined to be used in the context of text
documents, but my impression is that for data that contain more
structure, the XML variants are right now being developed (for
example XML-Schema, XML-RDF). So it will be good to wait a moment
before making decisions. And there is much to do regarding the
information model itself! I hope that we will have more discussions
about this.

2. I think Leigh Dodds did a good job in listing the advantages in
his XDelta document. Generally I think that using standards and
standard tools is a good idea. However, most certainly, XML will not
be an "ultimate standard", as Jean-Marc thinks it is. XML will be
certainly  replaced by improved mechanisms. My feeling is that it is
sufficiently relevant a step that it will be supported in a backwards
compatible way even in 50 years. Of course, nobody can predict this.

3. Regarding the issue of size of data set, verbosity, and data
compression: Some comments, esp. when it comes to "using it on
PalmTops etc." confuse the issue of an exchange format with a native
data format. Esp. given that XSLT will make it very easy to convert
data, any program will most likely have a native, usually binary
format that is optimized for operation speed and/or file size.
I think we should not consider size any factor of an _exchange_
format. This format should be as robust and compatible for the future
as possible. Many of us are developers of programs and tend to
underestimate the effort that goes into the development of data sets.
Our programs will certainly be replaced by better ones, but if the
data can be maintained, revised, and improved as it is done for
centuries with printed publications, I believe we will make better
progress in biodiversity research. The data sets are the gold, and
they should be preserved in a way that remains readable in 50 years.
Because of this, however, using compression algorithms and then write
it on a CD may be a bad idea for long term storage. Imagine having to
decompress something that was compressed with some program on a Apple
II machine...

I agree, especially that the software should be able to determine it.
Regarding XML, tags, and DTDs, I believe, the assumption is that
order does not matter, wherease an order can be imposed on attributes
within a tag, correct?

Does order matters for our problem? Where would it matter, any
examples from descriptive data?

In fact, thinking in my own relational information model, we have a
problem here: Some parts of the structure will be relating to
records, i.e. instances of an entity type. In my thinking, the order
of items to be described, and the order of characters used to perform
the description should NOT matter. It is a plausible user requirement
to report any of them in any order.

That does not mean that characters or states do not have an order,
but this order is secondary, and multiple orders are desirable. Being
ordered should not be a requirement of the exchange format.

However, there are other data elements that refer to attributes of
entities. Ordering them makes some parsing operations easier.
However, what fundamental advantages would it have to impose an order
on them?

Finally, some item are ordered, e.g. it will be desirable to impose
an order on multiple states in a descriptions. Written in (loose)
DELTA:

1,1/<rarely>2 -> Flowers blue or rarely white

may be different from

1,2/1<rarely> -> Flowers white or rarely blue

However, I believe that the DELTA method of using a text-sequence is
not necessarily the best solution. Alternatively, a data element may
be introduced to store the ordering information. For example,
DeltaAccess handles this problem with the numeric SEQ attribute of
the DESCR entity.

No, it is exactly the opposite. A DTD imposes an order on tags, but attributes
are unordered.

However, the November 5 working draft of XML Schema provides
mechanisms for settling tag order questions. XML Schema is a language for
specifying tag constraints in XML itself, rather than in the DTD
language which is not itself a special case of XML. Among other
things, it provides strong data typing, including the ability to
restrict the range of data, whereas in a DTD the only primitive data
type is a string.

It is slightly plausible that XML Schema would actually provide a good
data modeling language independent of whether one wished to use it as
an interchange language or as the native data store.

>From Alex R. Chapman (alexc@calm.wa.gov.au), 14/12/99, 10.46:

Kevin's comments concur with my earlier posting on the scope of this list's topic.
While reference to particular biological characters and attributes is essential to illustrate the potential functionality of any new standard system of representing descriptive data, it is surely beyond the scope of this group to attempt to develop or standardise the character lexicons themselves.  A worthy and extremely useful task (and here I specifically differ from Kevin T.) but surely a major threat to reporting back to TDWG with a new data model in a timely manner!

I would like to suggest that if part of our group think it is worthwhile to attempt to construct a standard character list for one or more (or all) kingdoms (to which I am not opposed) that we have an additional first level topic identifier for subject lines in our postings (currently we use GEN, RQT and XML).

Perhaps LEX - for the discussion of developing standard lexicons or name-space vocabularies for one or more fundamental taxonomic groups.

This way those most interested in this area can continue the debate. (It would be a fascinating outcome if most of the postings end up under this category!)

In fact such a sub-subgroup would perhaps help to provide a range of character types or exemplars with which we could test any proposed data model arising from the main discussion.

Cheers,
Alex

From: "Kevin Thiele" <kevin.thiele@PI.CSIRO.AU>, on 9/12/99 7:55:

There is a subtext running in this discussion - whether part of our scope is
the creation of lexicons or standard name-spaces - that to me is causing
confusion.

For instance:

>From Leigh:

But from Leigh again:

So do we or don't we? Am I misinterpreting these that they seem to say
opposite things?

The only problem with competing hierarchies is if we are trying to
standardise and resolve the conflicts. If every worker resolves for their
own project what to call bracts, this is not a problem for us.

>From Jean-Marc:

>species.

Are we? I thought we were designing a format by which such a vocabulary can
be represented.

For the record, all the current systems (DELTA, LucID, NEXUS etc) enforce
nothing lexically, they merely enforce a particular way of representing
data. Two data sets for similar groups of plants may contain entirely
different characters, or the same characters worded in different ways, or
the same characters resolved into states in different ways, or
(occasionally) identical characters. Comparing and combining datasets
automatically is thus impossible. This seems such a shame, but is it perhaps
unavoidable?

Thus, if we are designing vocabularies, we are going a long way beyond
what's been attempted before.

Personally, I think designing domain-specific vocabularies will never work,
unless the domain is the individual worker or group of collaborating
workers. The popularity of lexicons is the old seductive universalism again.
Great idea, but...

There are two problems. Firstly, there are (broadly) two types of characters
used in descriptions (and keys) - lets call them comparative and diagnostic
characters. Comparative characters are the fairly general ones - e.g. leaf
shape, ovary position - the sorts of characters that one would aim to
describe consistently for all taxa in a monograph. Diagnostic characters are
special characters that are useful for separating two or more taxa (of
course, sometimes fairly general characters are diagnostic, but not always).

A real example of a diagnostic character (from Synaphaea: Proteaceae):

Ovary with an apical ring of translucent glands......S. bifurcata
Ovary without glands.................................S. oulopha

Clearly, no generalised lexicon or name-space will allow for capture of such
diagnostic characters.

BUT, perhaps we can have a standardised representation for the generalised
characters using a lexicon and then use extensibility to allow user-specific
diagnostic characters? To some extent, but perhaps not...:

I will (foolishly) raise a challenge here that any generalised morphological
character that anyone can come up with (in the plant domain) will be
entirely inadequate for capturing data for some groups. For example, the
most straightforward character I can think of is

Leaves
 present
 absent

But, a diagnostic difference between Discaria pubescens and Discaria nitida
(Rhamnaceae) is the degree to which the leaves persist - in both, leaves
tend to be absent in the adult plant, but in D. pubescens they are often
completely absent while in D. nitida there are usually scattered reduced
leaves on younger branchlets. And in Podostemaceae and Utricularia there's
no guarantee that a leaf-like part is a leaf, because the conventional
differentiation of vegetative parts into leaves/stems doesn't hold.

Mother Nature's a tricky old dame, and any character definition will be
inadequate to catch her. But do we put up with the inadequacy for the
advantages that the universality brings? - if it means we constrain our
ability to capture data, then I'd say no.

So, I'd like to suggest that we try to develop a standardised data
representation, but put no constraints on character definitions whatsoever.

Cheers - k

Whatever happened to Richard Pankhurst's TDWG-based attempt to come up with
a minimum character set (or something) for just the (vascular? seed?
flowering?) plants?  I seem to remember there was a fair bit of wailing,
gnashing of teeth and slitting of wrists over this exercise...

Although some time has passed, I would like to take up something up
that was posed by Kevin under "(XML) XML?".

I see among other things already mentioned, 2 benefits:

1. A matrix is inherently ordering dependent. Reordering characters
or taxa is necessarily tied with the contents of data. In a more
verbose presentation (be it XML or not), these actions can be
decoupled. This is not currently an advantage as long as we mainly
use isolated programs with import/export interaction alone. However,
I believe in the future we will use programs working on networked
data. This could mean that I locally modify only the character
definition, perhaps translate it to German, define a character and
taxon subset for my use, and change character hierarchy or ordering,
but still cooperate with other groups using the same description data
on the net. That requires of course, that the descriptions use, at
least partially, standardized character definitions and that Globally
unique identifiers have been assigned to characters.

The advantage is not clear when thinking of DELTA, where the
character ID is local, and also identical with the character ordering
definition. These are understandable design limitation, which have
the advantage to produce simple and compact files. In the future, I
believe, we will want to be more flexible than this. In DeltaAccess,
I followed the DELTA example and coupled ID and ordering, which does
brings me quite some trouble currently...


2. Only with explicit and verbose tagging can be achieve forward AND
backward compatibility. If LucID would want to support additional
modifiers, perhaps change the 2 frequency states into a more specific
and complex system, or if it would want to allow state specific
reportable text and internal annotation (which are extremely
difficult to support in matrix notation anyways)
- the parser of a new application version would have to be changed
quite a bit, perhaps rewritten
- any older software would no longer be able to read these data.

With a well designed verbose, fully tagged format, both these
restrictions need not apply, I believe.

I believe we need structure, and we need support for quality control.
The distinction between text and data is blurred somewhat indeed, but
text must be structured in ways that can be processed analytically.
Free comments anywhere, where it is not clear to which data item a
comment belongs, will not help. Also, in free text the same concept
will often be expressed with different words. This is a common
problem known by anybody who tried to capture free conventional
descriptions in a database. For example, even in DELTA, frequency
statements in free text "comments" may express the same frequency by
multiple more or less synonymous wordings (is "mostly" and "usually"
the same or not?). All frequency wordings are not really defined, and
are therefore not accessible to analysis.

DeltaAccess tries to use textual frequency modifiers, where the
number of possible modifiers is restricted in the character
definition, and where each frequency modifier is defined as to the
exact upper and lower frequency range it presents. This is
analytically accessible.

... and is probably intractable.  One person can often see data in another
comments, while another may see others data as hardly worthy of comment.
In many descriptive works the pearls of information are subtle and implicit
rather than explicit and in your face (but we will not open the biological
description as an art versus a science debate).

Discussions about what is and is not data will go on forever and the
critera will change fron genus to genus, gamily to family, order to order,
and biologist to biologist.

What is needed is a common standard format to store all descriptive data
and information in an understandable and unambiguous way for exchange
between applications so that nothing gets lost or made unavailable in
transactions between applications and up and down the taxonomic hierachy.
To ignore data and information is probably excusable, but to actually lose
it is sinful and unpardonable.

It is a shame that verbosity is the price we have to pay for this
flexibility, but the tecnology can handle it.  I did not think we were
considering the 'direct processing' of these tagged XML (or whatever)
files; they were to be just the lingua franca of applictions using
descritpive data.  A contemporary example would be the DELTA format: after
Intkey, the DELTA Editor, MEKA or whatever have grabbbed the data they
neither know nor care what a DELTA file looks like.  What I think we are
after is a format like this that all applications know about and can use
without any extrenal hacking and preprocessing.

There is a major differece between an effective archival and exchange
format and an efficient arrangement of data for processing and analysis; I
doubt if it will be posible to have both in the same package.  My
understanding was that this list was going to focus on the former, while
application developers and closet hackers were going to whatever they
needed or wanted with the latter.

A recurring nightmare is the thought of pouring data backwards and forwards
between applicatons, losing a little at each export/import like the fraying
ends of an aging chromosome at each cell division, until eventually there
is nothing left...

People interested in XML file size will be interested in a new free
program XMill from AT&T Research Labs and UPenn. XMill is said to
compress files up to twice as much as gzip on proprietary formats when
data in those formats is first rendered in XML and then compressed
with XMill. This is essentially because XMill can use the tag
information to reorganize the data for greater redundancy.

http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/xmill/

points to the software and technical material about it.

One of the authors, Dan Suciu, is also the a co-author of "Data on the
Web : From Relations to Semistructured Data and XML", Morgan Kaufman.
This is great book whose title is accurate. To read it, you have to be
comfortable with graph theory, regular expressions, and finite state
automata. If you are not, you can accept this a summary: XML is more
general than relational databases and a little less general than pure
object oriented databases.

Originally, the definition of applied schema ("character
definitions", lexica, terminology) is outside the scope of this
discussion group. While judging from my own experience I think it
unlikely to make fast progress here, I completely agree that it is
most important to work on it. I would therefore endorse Alex's
proposal to create a new top level subject:

->  Please do use a subject line (LEX) if you want to talk about
applied terminology for a certain group (all plants, all insects,
etc.)

If these discussion threads become too big, we should then open a new
list for those interested in it.

The concept of "overloading" is very good, I think it helps to understand
the issue. I believe in the new standard, we will want to have as little
overloading (which means context specific contents) as possible.
In general, all data elements should be defined much more exactly
than in Delta. Many things in Delta are really defined by result, not
by purpose, which means that comments may have a different function
in different applications (e.g. identification or nat. language
reporting).

If I understand this correctly, it assumes that there would be a
general "property" entity. An instance of this entity would then be
the property "shape", which has a list of generally applicable
values. Some of these values would apply to leaves as well as to
butterfly wings, other may be more specific.

I wonder, whether terminology is actually well developed enough to
really support this notion. The discussion is somewhat similar to the
discussion on lexicons/globally applicable character definitions.

My feeling is, that nowhere ever has "shape" been defined in a way
that would be applicable to all areas. Defining dependency rules to
create overlapping, or partly matching sets of character state seems
to me a troublesome process.

Further, one should realize that we need more than a name for such
concepts. Two shapes in plants and butterfly wings that may be more
or less identical in concept may be named identical in one language,
but not in another.

I believe that properties are useful (and from the viewpoint of
information modeling are preferable to use), but dangerous to use in
reality, simply because we as biologists never did any globally
applicable terminology. Also, we have to make the concept clear to
any user, e.g. that if she or he changes the name of a state, this
change is actually applicable not only to his butterfly, but also to
the plant the collegue is working on in the same database (a bit
gross example, but more likely somewhere in a large institution for
two people working on separate orders, or perhaps on ferns and
conifers).

Who thinks global state lists for something like shape (already
separated into 2D-shape, 3D-shape), texture, smell, color, are
possible and useful?

What problems do we have with dependency relationships (or integrity
rules, to put it another way)?

Most of us are familiar with the dependency as implemented in DELTA
compatible applications. here one character is defined as
controlling, and that depending on which states is scored in a given
item, other characters become applicable or inapplicable in that
item. Questions:

1. Do we need both applicable and inapplicable definitions?

In DeltaAccess I assumed that applicable is the complement of
inapplicable. If the complement of applicable states are defined as
inapplicable, the application behaves the same way. This is only
partly true.

a) If new states are added in the definition, some care is necessary.
I realized that in DeltaAccess, but thought it the lesser problem.
However, for the same reason for which we may need actually a "not"
statement in the item description (a statement "color of X is NOT
pure white" remains true, regardless of how many shades of beige are
later added later on)

b) If multiple state are scored, the behavior needs to be defined. In
the CSIRO programs, it seems that if two states are scored in a given
item, a single one is sufficient to make another characters
applicable or inapplicable (which makes sense, but is lost if the
complement is choosen).

I have not found a good generalization for this, but loath to
implement the rules in duplicate. Any ideas? This is certainly a
question I am thinking about on the logical rather than conceptual
level, but answering it may help to define the requirements, i.e.
whether the DELTA applicable/inapplicable model should be followed,
or whether alternative expressions are possible.


2. I recently had a good discussion with Wouter Addink and Flip Boer
in Holland. Among other things we considered whether a structural
hierarchy (leaf stalk is part of leaf is part of plant) could replace
dependency rules. Clearly, it can replace some rules: if there is no
leaf, all leaf characters will be inapplicable. However, it can not
replace depencies based on multiple states that are not
present/absence. Further, it may not always be true because we tend
to use confusing terminology: Something at the leaf stalk base would
belong to leaf stalk, but absence of leaf stalk (i.e. absence of
measurable lenght of leaf stalk) does not imply absence of stalk
based characters. Any further ideas on this?


3. (and finally): Does anybody have good examples where character
_state_ dependencies would be necessary? This has been proposed for
New Delta. I have no real objections, except that I have not found a
good example where I would want to have it.

Long answer: The key word here is 'global'.  Comprehensive state lists are
obviously possible and useful as people create and use them all the time
within their discipline.  Many of the terms are shared across disciplines,
reflecting common usage or common greek/latin derivation.  But a
mathematician's or engineers concept of what is acceptable as round,
cylindical, elliptical, linear, pentagonal, etc. is very different to a
biologists (although they would probably understand what we mean).

But I think the pressure against achieving global state-lists are
historical, political and sociological more than technical.  Biologists
tend not to work across taxonomic disciplines and carry the lexicons
backwards and forwards, and major and minor differences in descriptive
practice and terminology evolve.  Botanists, entomologists, icthyologists
all describe shapes of flat structures (scales, leaves, petals, wings,
fins, etc.) and I suspect there are differences in how they do this (but
not working across disciplines will never be sure), and neither discipline
is going to want give up their traditional practices - (why does the word
'biocode' keep coming into my mind here?).  In any case, does it really
matter that different disciplines use words for the same thing?

It may be possible to to achieve consistency within a discipline but even
there I have doubts - who is going to adjudicate on what is the correct
terminology for the circular/round/orbicular thing, and if it is not one
thing, how do all the things that are sort of like it differ.  And having
adjudicated, who is going to enforce the decision, and interfere with the
freedom of of expression, the right to vote for the multinational company
of your choice, the right to bear arms and so on.  As I said, political,
and I do not think we want to go there.

A gut feeling is if we go down the universal lexicon/terminolgy route a lot
of biologists will go round in ever decreasing concentric circles,
eventually vanishing up their own centroid never to be seen again.

Each discipline and discipline with discipline can and will develop and use
terminology/lexicons/state-lists that biologists and information managers
have to work with.  That is the reality that we are given - I periodically
try to change reality to make information management easier, but inevitably
get beaten to pulp rather than thanked.

What we can aim for is a data structure that enables disciplines and
biologists to use terminology they are comfortable with, storing and
documenting it in an unambiguous form that does not inhibit flexibility.
DELTA and like programs allow users to do this now: by changing one word, I
can change 'frond' to 'leaf', which it is, everywhere (but I like the word
'frond', so I won't)...  Thus data can be converted and integrated later
when the public realizes the true value of my lifetimes's work on the
monograph and combined interactive key to the marine pteridophytes and
benthic butterflies of the continental Antarctica.

Short answer: no.  Most important is a sound informatiom model and
corresponding data structure.  If we get it right, the data will clean
itself up. :)

Actually, what I'd like to see as a requirement is more modest than this.
I simply propose that there should be the possibility of explicitly
recording a property name, which need not have any global significance.

The property could be expressed in many ways, but for the sake of an
example I suggest that we might possibly have a DELTA character that
looked like this:

  #2. body <@property degree of convexity>/
       1. strongly flattened/
       2. slightly flattened to moderately convex/
       3. strongly convex/

You've probably considered these already, but for the sake of discussion:

example 1.  Say you want to allow a more or less accurate state for a
"time of year" character.  In that case the month would be dependent on a
year, and the day would be dependent on the month.

example 2.  You want your user to be able to choose more or less accurate
geographical locations.

Whether these examples would ever really occur is a question, but I'm not
sure we need to proscribe the use of state dependencies.

Thats actually what I was suggesting (albeit probably not that clearly).
i.e <property name="shape"> or similar. "shape" may have meaning within
a particular domain. If possible that meaning ought to be standardised.
If it can't, then the loss is in interoperability between groups in that
domain.

Inter-domain exchange of information is a much more difficult nut to
crack.

Ideally both the body character, its property, and the values would be
standardised - but thats a different issue, and one that is orthogonal
to the design of the information model.

As Jim Croft said, the information model is the important point, and the
first 'deliverable'. After that, when people actually start using the model,
standardisation can be explored if necessary. But that process shouldn't
stop the model from being derived in the first place.

Cheers,

L.

I absolutely agree that this should be done. Using properties as a
classification of characters only, it somewhat comes near to the
original intend for properties as published in Diederich: Getting a
grip on character definitions that run into 100s of characters. I
believe that properties can be best recorded on two levels:

1. A global property classification (I believe this should follow the
physical units (1D/2D/3D shape and measurement, time point and
duration, temperature, etc.) + human senses, to distinguish taste,
smell, etc., + things for pattern/arrangement. I believe centering it
on the human observer will make it domain independent.

2. On a second level detailed Properties could be introduced that
could, but not necessarily must be domain specific, like WingShape
(2D Shape), LeafShape (2D Shape), FungalSporeShape (3D Shape).

These should be extensible in the model.

Clearly there would have been an advantage to the global model. Each
state for a property would truly only exist once. If a character set
is to be translated, the color states would have to be translated
only once, and not separately for each structure the color of which
is described. From the responses so far, however, I think we all do
not really believe this could work out.

I believe there is an intermediate way, and that is providing
templates for properties togehter with states. The more templates
that could be offered, the easier the setup of a character definition
would be. But the templates would be copied, not linked, so that e.g.
too many color states could be copied from the template, and then
reduced or changed as needed.

OK, what I see here is the question to introduce an implicit "data
present" dependency. Only if a character is used in an item, be it
with categorical states, numerical measurements, or text, other
characters would become visible.

I think this would be useful. For numerical chars there would be a
work-around (see below, mapping from -1e308 to +1e308 or whatever is
the computers idea of inifinity...), but this would not work for
text. It could also help eliminating some "data present" characters
that are occasionally found in Delta data sets just to define a
dependency.

What do the DELTA cracks think about this?

The symbol to define such dependencies could be the "*" used commonly
for "any value".

---
For the sake of completeness: If other states shall depend on certain
values, this is not a problem, since one would define a character
state mapping (DELTA: KEYSTATES) say:
  Char 1: Seed size, length (numeric) [=B5m]
  Char 2: Seed size, class
   state 1: Char1 < 2 mm
   state 1: Char1 >=3D 2 mm
Some characters that can only be observed in larger seeds could then
be made dependent on 2,2

As an n-dimensional continuum, colour has always been dificult to quantify
- the number and size of available templates is mind-blowing.  And so much
is subjective - true believers know the colour turquoise is a green,
heretics insist it is a blue; and where are the boundaries around and
within the violet/indigo/purple/mauve/lilac impression?

petals white/pink/red/orange/yellow/green/blue/purple is simple enough, but
there are problems where you might want to draw a distinction betwen
scarlet and crimson, or the intensity of the hue (almost white, but did it
get there by losing yellow or losing green or by gaining a little bit of
red?).

In the interests of precision and flexibility it would seem sensible to
adopt a property/scheme/value model like the metadata bods tend to do.
That way you could be as precise as you like with Royal Hort. Soc.,
Munsell, Panatone, etc. colour charts, or R/B/G and C/M/Y ratios and people
could work out exactly what you thought you were dealing with.

The only trouble is the data becomes completely unintelligible an
meaningless to the average human - a perfect no-win situation.

But there are probably instances where you would want to do such a thing,
and our model should accommodate it.

As Kevin has pointed out several times, the notion of universal lexicons or
vocabularies is incredibly seductive, but often involve a lot of work and
running around that rarely results in the promised joy and bliss.  Sort of
like a global currency and free trade - a good idea, but not likely to
happen.  Our best bet is to resist the tempation to build the complete
description of all things right away, but to model and plan exactly what it
is we are tyring to do; the tools and raw ingredients will follow.

This seems to characterize in a nutshell the problem discussed earlier
contrasting qualitative and quantitative definitions when the underlying basis
of comparison is not independent between two characters, but yet only loosely
associated.  For both, one must understand the context of both "size" and
"length" with respect to some reference frame.  Further both use different
units.  Also one or the other may have associations with other characters
(basis of comparisons), also perhaps loose that determine the dependency of
other characters.

It might be useful to require a tagging language that permits one to wrap such
characters with a generalized, but controlled vocabulary that fully (to the
depth required) specifies the basis of comparison and its map onto the objects
for which the comparison is useful (character domain).  Presumably a
generalized basis of comparison would have a name that may or may not be
identical to that used by the original author and that might give a
generalized definition to a particular class of properties (basis/es of
comparison).   Tags that allow ancillary metadata associated specific
instances, including its first use, author, citation, etc, would also be
useful.

As Gregor's example shows, we also need to allow other "loosely associated"
characters (say "size" characters for objects of class "x", where here "x" is
"seeds") to also be associated (machine callable) independently of their
precise definitions/useage, which may actually differ subtly among workers.
In terms of adding the potential to broaden or narrow a search for other
related relevant datasets/characters, one might wish to be careful in stating
exactly what one might mean by seed (embryonic sporophyte) in its most general
context applying categorical "adjectives" to both refine the intended meaning
and maximize the useful extent of its potential associations.

Use of such a "wrapper or tagging language" would require the specific
character be embedded into a controlled generalized character hierarchy or
definition space, much as Gregor has done, but in more general terms that lend
themselves to increasing precision through refinement.  For some applications
one might not need to attach all the metadata, since much could potentially be
"inherited" from higher levels of generality, leaving most workers to include
"content/domain specific" wording as given in the example, and perhaps a few
key "lower level generalities" that could inherit higher-order properties
within a generalized system needed to assure the comparability of datasets and
character definitions across a wide variety of scales, taxa, and
context-specific feature sets.

For quantitative characters one would need to provide enough information to
specify exactly what one means by length (or details of the algorithm used, if
this is machine defined); units of measure would be needed.  The mass property
would be much easier than a length or other general_size measure, it would
simply need to be specified in grams or suitable scale factor (kilograms,
picograms, etc).

So for the two characters one might wrap them something like (syntax possibly
more suitably arranged for
XML or DELTA, NEXUS, etc. translation) and with thought as to which are
objects, which are attributes of objects, and which are attributes of
attributes of objects, likewise the same for the character domains (taxa),
etc, and perhaps the data  itself (or representations of data) :

could associate groups of characters yet be maintained separate from a fully
self-describing protocol so that calls to the data archives, say for subsets

"know" how to read data and make the suitable translations (and infer
dependencies where possible, but sometimes using <UNDEFINED>  or
<UNRESOLVED>as a default when required), without the need to send "fully
tagged" meta-data unless required.

Based on examples given so far, alternatives to the @property might include as
a simple start "general_size" "general_shape" "general composition" and
"general color".

With respect to @character_type we have so far discussed two "quantiative" and
"qualitative" but one could envision at least two more "mixed"  and
"molecular", although potentially the last might be considered a subtype.

Left out of the foregoing would be a specification to deal with parts and
subparts of objects upon which characters are defined.  This has been touched
on repeatedly in several threads.  I'm not enough of a Botantist to know
exactly what subpart of a plant a seed is, although I would assume that it
might be defined in multiple ways depending upon things like germ layer,
topographic position, life cycle.  This may be more difficult, since
dependency may be determined on both how other characters are defined and the
specific taxa (character domain) in question.

If we are careful in circumscribing a generalized character markup language,
the user (or subsequent user) could then decide how powerful a
characterization would likely be useful, without having to specify every
conceivable domain-specific tag, while at the same time building a largely
self-refining system (assuming there is some permanancy to the data and
metadata).  Those most familiar with DELTA or NEXUS, etc. would have to bother
with only a minimal set of wrappers to characterize data in these formats,
depending upon need, whereas others may add characterization to existing
wrappers where it is deemed insufficient (eg. range data that inherently
includes landmarks and positional relationships among landmarks in Euclidean
space).  Interfaces could be built to assist in traversing domain specific
vocabulary, to either more fully encode or strip off tags as required, to
validate character data submittted for publication prior to archival, as well
as search for and compare specific characters and study their general
usefulness or properties.

The precise syntax needs to be flexible, yet be able to characterize
characters in general terms that would lend themselves to refinements of
meaning, as specific as required for a given context (domain).   However we do
it, it is critical that we focus on ensuring that we are defining the basis of
comparision with sufficient precision to insure that results are comparable
and with sufficient generality to insure that our searches of  "feature or
taxon" space have broad applicability.   It would be definitely nice if the
system is general enough to permit morphological characters to be studied side
by side with molecular data, which through evolution seem to be universally
coded through an elegantly simple arrangement of base-pairs.

I see it as more object oriented rather than heirarchical.  A plant
has properties root, stem, leaf, inflorescence.  Each of which can
also have properties.  A leaf has color, shape, pubescens etc.  If
"pubescence" is defined in a general way, it doesn't need to be
redefined each time an object can possess pubescens.  Just the once
should be sufficient.

In the case of your above example, I would tend to make "stipules" a
property of "leaf" rather than "petiole."  The leaf could have properties
"blade," "petiole," and "stipule;" where each would also possess certain
properties.  Normally, the way that you defined things, stipule characters
couldn't exist if they're tied to the petiole.

The SDD Wiki has moved to the TDWG Twiki platform 
http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/WebHome
If you don't care, you can stop reading now.

For a number of technical reasons, time constraints, and privacy issues, 
it is difficult to move wiki presences from one organization to another, 
so if you are a registered user at the old umb  wiki but not already at 
the tdwg wiki platform, you need to re-register. Note however that I 
\have/ copied the email notification list to the new wiki, and if you 
merely register with the same wiki name, notification will resume. You 
can check out http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/WebNotify. If your 
name appears there with a "?" it means that there is not presently a 
registration for you at the tdwg wiki. If you choose a different wiki 
name than you had at umb, you will need to edit that page if you want 
mail notification.

Dear SDD interest group members!

Please do consider coming to TDWG 2007 in Bratislava! 

The following topics may be of interest to you:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 1. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D

A 90 minute session on Wednesday, 19 Sep called:
  "Descriptive model for analysis, identification, 
   description markup, and taxon pages"

As the name implies, analyses of all kind of descriptive data models are 
welcome, regardless whether they use SDD or not. Criticism of SDD version =
1.1 
is also welcome. Due to the launching of the Encyclopedia of Life the taxo=
n 
page topic is especially relevant.

Pleasse note that the SDD interest group is not just concerned with 
morphological data. Data useful for identification, genetic, or phylogenet=
ic 
analyses are limited to morphology, and the interested group considers all=
 that 
are inherent to a taxon (genetically or environmentally coded so they are 
stable. This includes molecular descriptive data like sequences or pattern=
s, 
behavior, physiology, etc.

Stressing a general perspective both with regard to the kind of data and w=
ith 
regard to how the data are gathered and used will be important and welcome=
. In 
the light of the current parallel development of the SPM model, we need to=
 
assess whether separate models are needed for specific purposes, or whethe=
r a 
general model can be maintained as SDD presents currently.

If you whish to participate in this session, please send a rough draft (ti=
tle 
and abstract may change later) to g.hagedorn@bba.de until 20th Juli.

Limited travel funds for students without funding may be available, coveri=
ng 
one of transport costs, per diem (~US$71/night) or accommodation.


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 2. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D

Existing applications of SDD are also welcome in further sessions on the 
following day, where two sessions are reserved for "Applications of TDWG 
standards".


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 3. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D

On Saturday the SDD interest group will meet. Possible topics: 

 1. Which way ahead? XML-schema, natural language markup or RDF? 
    Are these combinable?
 2. Who wants to lead task groups for feature-vocabularies and ontologies?
 2. Which priorities may help to choose? 
 3. Usability of current SDD schema for natural language markup

Please add to this list or propose what you would consider to be most 
important.

Please note that =C9amonn will hold a group discussion about the "Species
Profile Model" (previously known as "Taxon Data Model") during the 16.00-1=
8.00 
slot on Tues 18th Sept. I suggest that people interested in SDD should als=
o go 
to that meeting. I therefore propose a meeting on the last day (Saturday)

***If you are interested in in-depth discussion, please check your 
   travel plans and try to stay until Sept. 22nd, afternoon. Thanks! ***

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 4. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D

We will try to have a "late-night show" (working group) on studying SDD an=
d RDF 
on one evening, currently Tuesday. All SDD or RDF "experts" are welcome to=
 
that. 

It would probably make sense to suggest a separate task group for descript=
ive 
data in SPM? Can you have a name for it?

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D 4. =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

I unfortunately will not be attending TDWG 2007, however with regards to =
taxon pages I just wanted to point out the ongoing development work that =
is being done in the Planetary Biodiversity Inventory Solanum project:
http://www.nhm.ac.uk/solanaceaesource

A typical taxon page can be viewed here:
http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/solanaceaesource/taxonomy=
/description-detail.jsp?spnumber=3D1065

We are not currently using SDD, nor are the natural language =
descriptions marked up. The description is merely split into sections, =
each of which is stored as a separate memo field in the description =
record. I welcome any comments or questions.

Many thanks,
Lisa

Stressing a general perspective both with regard to the kind of data and =
with regard to how the data are gathered and used will be important and =
welcome. In the light of the current parallel development of the SPM =
model, we need to assess whether separate models are needed for specific =
purposes, or whether a general model can be maintained as SDD presents =
currently.

If you whish to participate in this session, please send a rough draft =
(title and abstract may change later) to g.hagedorn@bba.de until 20th =
Juli.

Limited travel funds for students without funding may be available, =
covering one of transport costs, per diem (~US$71/night) or =
accommodation.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Existing applications of SDD are also welcome in further sessions on the =

On Saturday the SDD interest group will meet. Possible topics:=20

 1. Which way ahead? XML-schema, natural language markup or RDF?=20
    Are these combinable?
 2. Who wants to lead task groups for feature-vocabularies and =
ontologies?
 2. Which priorities may help to choose?=20
 3. Usability of current SDD schema for natural language markup

Please add to this list or propose what you would consider to be most=20
important.

Please note that =C9amonn will hold a group discussion about the =
"Species
Profile Model" (previously known as "Taxon Data Model") during the =
16.00-18.00=20
slot on Tues 18th Sept. I suggest that people interested in SDD should =
also go=20
to that meeting. I therefore propose a meeting on the last day =
(Saturday)

***If you are interested in in-depth discussion, please check your=20
   travel plans and try to stay until Sept. 22nd, afternoon. Thanks! ***

We will try to have a "late-night show" (working group) on studying SDD =
and RDF=20
on one evening, currently Tuesday. All SDD or RDF "experts" are welcome =
to=20

It would probably make sense to suggest a separate task group for =

Dear SDD interest group members!

Ten days ago I asked who is interested in talking at TDWG 2007 in Bratisla=
va
on descriptive data, adding:

"If you whish to participate in this session, please send a rough draft (t=
itle 
and abstract may change later) to g.hagedorn@bba.de until 20th Juli."

Some may have overlooked this; so far I have received no responses. Unless=
 I 
receive sufficient calls until Saturday, 28th of July the session:

Wednesday 1530-1700
  "Descriptive model for analysis, identification, 
  description markup, and taxon pages"

may have to be canceled completely.

Please consider whether you can participate, I do hope for an interesting 
meeting! 

Please note that I will not be able to organize the session after Aug. 3, =
going 
on vacation then. The session schedule would have to be fixed before that =
time 
and the general deadline of August 15th therefore cannot be applied to thi=
s 
session. You can change both title and abstract however after we agreed on=
 the 
schedule.

Please respond as soon as possible, many thanks!

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-sdd,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-sdd into tdwg-content. The list tdwg-sdd will be =
closed and removed once the archives have been merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=
