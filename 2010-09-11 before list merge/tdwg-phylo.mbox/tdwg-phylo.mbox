Dear TDWG groups,

I would like to inform you about a new TDWG mailing list that was =20
created today for discussing any TDWG standard definitions on a non =20
technical level.
The new list was created to help cross pollination of ideas between =20
the different TDWG groups and avoid the frequent duplication of work =20
that we have encountered so often in the past years.

Every subgroup is free to decide whether they want to freeze their =20
existing mailing list and migrate discussions to the central tdwg-=20
content list. If you want to take this step, please let me know and I =20=

will take the required actions. A frozen mailing list will disallow =20
any new posts or member subscriptions, but the existing archive will =20
continue to be publicly available. An autoresponder will also be =20
configured to inform future users of the new content list. By default =20=

I will transfer all existing subscriptions to the new list, so people =20=

don't have to subscribe again.

You can also subscribe manually to the new mailing list here:
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content


In addition to that, the 3 existing mailing lists that deal with =20
technical issues have already decided to hold all discussions from now =20=

on on the technical architecture group (TAG) list. The existing guid =20
and tapir mailing lists have been frozen today.

Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring

Hi Everyone,

it's been a while since the TDWG Meeting and workshop in Perth. Many  
of you on this list have participated in the workshop, and it was  
great to meet you there. I found the workshop to be productive and  
very encouraging towards forming this Interest Group in a way that has  
unique value.

You may have noticed that we have our own TDWG wiki site at

http://wiki.tdwg.org/Phylogenetics/

You can navigate there easily manually by going to the TDWG home page (http://tdwg.org 
), then click 'Wiki' in the left hand navigation bar, then  
'Phylogenetics'.

I've put up already last year some minimal initial content about what  
we are about, and I also put up information about and notes from our  
Perth workshop:

http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/PhylogeneticsStandardsWorkshop

While there hasn't been much activity since on the charter and the  
BioSynC proposal due to the I guess all too familiar year-end frenzy,  
this will change over the next few months. Stay tuned, we'll keep you  
in the loop. Also, this is meant to be a discussion much more than an  
announcement forum, so if you have any suggestions, concerns, or  
thoughts, please don't hesitate to voice them here.

Speaking of keeping in the loop, I'll shortly forward a call for  
participation in a NESCent-organized event that is very closely  
aligned with the phylogenetics standards and targeted at the  
interoperability issues we were talking about in Perth.

As for Markus' email, I don't know to what extent you have been part  
of the respective discussion but I wasn't. While I see the possible  
benefits of better avoiding the reinventing the wheel, I find the  
question of merging with another and much larger community when we  
aren't one really yet a bit premature, and I am concerned that the  
loss of focus might cause some to tune out or ignore the list (more  
than they might otherwise), which I find the much bigger risk than  
reinventing as the latter can be prevented by cross-talk and  
subscribing to multiple lists (which I'm used to, but again maybe not  
everyone is).

That's just my opinion though - please don't hesitate to voice yours,  
especially if you feel differently.

Cheers,

	-hilmar

     NESCent Hackathon on Evolutionary Database Interoperability

                     OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent; http:// 
nescent.org) is sponsoring an "Evolutionary Database Interoperability"  
hackathon aimed at enhancing the value (and raising the profile) of  
important community resources for evolutionary and biodiversity data  
by increasing their accessibility to users and software. We are  
broadly soliciting applications for participation from the community.  
More information about the event is available online at http://evoinfo.nescent.org/Database_Interop_Hackathon 
.

A hackathon is an event at which a group of programmers who otherwise  
do not have the opportunity to interact on a routine basis meet with  
users and domain experts to collaboratively develop working code that  
is of utility to the community as a whole. The Database  
Interoperability Hackathon will bring together developers from a  
number of emerging standards for evolutionary data exchange (NeXML; http://nexml.org 
), data and metadata semantics (CDAO; http://www.evolutionaryontology.org 
), and programmatic access of evolutionary data providers (PhyloWS; http://evoinfo.nescent.org/PhyloWS) 
  with database programmers and metadata experts from a variety of  
evolutionary and biodiversity community resources. In addition, the  
mix of people will include programmers of embeddable widgets, mash-up  
and aggregation applications that can showcase the value of the effort  
for research applications.

We also welcome comments and suggestions for issues in database  
interoperability that could be addressed at the event but are not yet  
on our radar. Please email the organizers at hackathon3@nescent.org  
with any suggestions you have.

GOALS AND ACTIVITIES

The focus of the programming aspect of the meeting will be to promote  
interoperability among online evolutionary databases through the  
following core set of activities.
1) Mapping the data and operation semantics of the participating  
online resources to an ontology, CDAO.
2) Implement a NeXML transformation for participating online resources  
as a formally defined query input and data output.
3) Implementation of programmable web-service interfaces following the  
emerging PhyloWS standard.
4) Showcase some of the possibilities that can arise from achieving  
data provider interoperability through small integration and/or mash- 
up oriented prototype applications.

Supporting activities will include discussing input from end-users,  
discussing compliance with emerging reporting standards (MIAPA) and  
documentation of solutions and open problems on the hackathon wiki.


ORGANIZATION

The event will be 5 days in duration and will take place at NESCent in  
Durham, North Carolina, on March 9-13, 2009. Participant travel,  
accommodation, expenses for meals, etc, will be paid by NESCent.  
Logistical and travel details will be communicated to accepted and  
confirmed participants.

The specific development targets will be selected by the participants  
through a hackathon wiki, a mailing list, and one or more conference  
calls. The exact agenda for the event will be developed similarly, but  
will be largely devoted to coding time. At the event itself,  
participants will self-organize into small subgroups (of 2-5) focused  
on particular targets.

The NeXML, CDAO, and PhyloWS standards are products of the  
Evolutionary Informatics working group (http://evoinfo.nescent.org),  
under the auspices of whom this event is being organized.


CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

We invite all individuals interested in attending to apply by  
responding to the questions below. We specifically encourage  
applications from members of underrepresented groups, specifically  
women and minorities, and from graduate students and postdocs.

1. Please indicate if you would be available for all or only for part  
of the March 9-13 time period.

2. All code and documentation produced at the event is to be made  
available immediately under an OSI-approved open-source license or a  
Creative Commons license. Please indicate if this would pose any  
difficulty for your participation.

3. Please briefly describe your qualifications (programming languages,  
metadata standards, experience with data schemas, web-service  
programming, mash-up programming, etc).

4. Please state what you would most like to accomplish at the  
hackathon, given your current understanding.  If you would not be  
writing software at the event, please state how you would like to  
contribute and how you would expect to benefit.

5. Please indicate if you are a member of an underrepresented group  
(including women, persons with disabilities, and any of the following  
minorities: African American, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska  
Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander).

To apply, please enter your personal information and your responses by  
February 5 into the online form at
http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p6ikV0To6fXpJ369ozyNSSw&hl=en

In addition, if possible please email a CV to the organizers at hackathon3@nescent.org 
  by the same deadline.  If you are interested in participating but  
are unable to respond in full by that deadline, please let us know as  
soon as possible. Please understand that the funds as well as the  
space for this event are limited. We also need to balance a critical  
mass of developers in certain areas of expertise with a broad  
participation of different data providers, and so not all qualified  
applicants can be guaranteed acceptance.

Yours,

The Organizing Committee
Arlin Stoltzfus, Rutger Vos (Evolutionary Informatics Working Group)

Hi all:

NESCent is getting ready for participating in the 2009 Google Summer of
Code. The skeleton for the project ideas page, along with a template
for project ideas, is online:

http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009

A big part of the strength of our application as a participating
organization comes from our project ideas and a diverse roster of
primary and secondary mentors. If you have an idea for carving out a
summer programming project for a student, and/or can fancy yourself
mentoring a student, or are simply enthusiastic about helping out, for
example as a backup mentor, please let me know, and I will send you a
summary of how the Summer of Code program works in principle, as well
as guidelines for how to become a mentor for us or help out in other
ways.

For comparison purposes, previous years' ideas pages are here:
http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2008
http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2007

As for supporting standards within the program, last year for example  
one of the funded projects was on phyloXML support in BioPerl.

Cheers,

	-hilmar

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2009

http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a  
mentoring organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http:// 
code.google.com/soc/).

Students in the program will receive a stipend from Google (and  
possibly more importantly, a T-shirt solely available to successful  
participants), and may work from their home, or home institution, for  
the duration of the 3 month program. Each student will have at least  
one dedicated mentor to show them the ropes and help them complete  
their project.

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. Initial project ideas  
are listed on the website. These range from hardware accerelation for  
phylogenetic inference, to tree visualization within a wiki, to  
alignment of next-gen sequencing data, to development of a reusable  
ontology term markup module for biocuration. All project ideas are  
flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match the skills of the  
student.  We also welcome novel project ideas that dovetail with  
student interests.

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2009 - STUDENT APPLICATION DEADLINE IS  
APRIL 3

http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a mentoring  
organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http://code.google.com/soc/ 
).

Students in the program will receive a stipend from Google (and a T- 
shirt solely available to successful participants), and may work from  
their home, or home institution, for the duration of the 3 month  
program. Each student will have at least one dedicated mentor to show  
them the ropes and help them complete their project.

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. Project ideas are  
listed on the website and range from hardware acceleration for  
phylogenetic inference, to support for phyloinformatics standards  
within the BioPerl and BioRuby toolkits, to alignment of next-gen  
sequencing data, to ontology term markup for biocuration, to semantic  
interoperability of web-services, to 3D-printing of phylogenies. All  
project ideas are flexible and many can be adjusted in scope to match  
the skills of the student.  We also welcome novel project ideas that  
dovetail with student interests.

TO APPLY: Instructions are at the website (see "When you apply"). You  
can find GSoC program rules and eligibility requirements at http://socghop.appspot.com 
. ***The 12-day application period for students ends on Friday, April  
3rd, 2009, at 19:00 UTC (3pm EDT, 12pm PDT).***

INQUIRIES: phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly encourage all  
interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early  
as possible.

Hi,

I was just wondering, is it possible to obtain, somewhere from the net, the
full phylogenetic tree for life on earth?

How big would the data be? How many nodes are there (counting a species, and
every split in the graph, as a node)?

I'm thinking of fitting it inside the interatctorium (www.interactorium.net)

Cheers

FYI, a group of collaborators (Arlin Stoltzfus, Karen Cranston,  
Sheldon McKay, Enrico Pontelli, Nico Cellinese, and myself) under the  
leadership of Arlin recently pulled together a grant application for  
the NSF Interop solicitation.

The ideas for the grant emerged mostly from the recent Database  
Interoperability Hackathon (for which I posted the announcement and  
Call for Participation here back in Jan). Proposal summary and full  
text are public at the following URL:

http://evoinfo.nescent.org/NSF_Interop_Proposal

It was submitted July 22. If funded, TDWG and this Interest Group will  
play a significant role in the proposed activities.

We probably won't hear about reviews or funding before Feb/March next  
year, so keep fingers crossed until then.

Cheers,

	-hilmar

Hi all,

as I'm sure you've noticed already, the 2009 TDWG Conference is coming  
up and only about 2 months away. Nico and I hope to see as many of you  
there as possible!

As the one remaining TODO needed to complete the formal establishment  
of our TDWG Interest Group, we need to get the group's charter  
written, finalized, and approved.

Nico and I have now written a draft charter here:

http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhdjhbvd_65ff7bp3dn

Since in order to be approved by the executive committee in time for  
the 2009 conference it needs to be submitted rather soon. So, we'd be  
much obliged if you can review the draft and give us feedback,  
comments, and suggestions by Friday, Sep 11, so we can incorporate it  
in time for submitting the final version on Monday, Sep 14.

FYI, there'll likely be significant activities of our group at the  
event, the announcements and Calls for Participation for which will be  
posted here over the coming week. Pending final approval for funding  
and logistics, one of these will be a VoCamp; check out http://evoinfo.nescent.org/VoCamp1_Proposal 
  if you're curious.

Cheers,

Hilmar & Nico

NESCent Phyloinformatics VoCamp

OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Integrating diverse biological data with the historical process of =20
evolution
is a grand challenge for 21st century biology. The interoperability of =20=

data
from diverse fields (e.g., genetics, ecology, biodiversity, biomedicine)
requires a technology infrastructure based on formalized, shared
vocabularies.  Developing such vocabularies is a community project.  In
order to build controlled vocabularies and ontologies, the National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent: http://nescent.org) is =20
sponsoring a
"Phyloinformatics VoCamp".

We invite scientists from diverse sub-disciplines to apply for this =20
event,
as explained below. The application deadline is September 18, 2009. More
information about motivation, plans, and preliminary ideas is available
online at http://bit.ly/VoCamp_Proposal.  Feel free to disseminate this
notice to colleagues who may be interested.*

A VoCamp (http://vocamp.org) is an intense, hands-on, working meeting =20=

with
face-to-face interactions between a diverse group of people focused on
vocabulary and ontology design, development and application.  The
Phyloinformatics VoCamp will include ontology and vocabulary =20
developers from
relevant efforts, experts on knowledge representation and reasoning, and
users and developers of integrative applications that use these =20
ontologies.

This event will partially overlap with the Biodiversity Information
Standards (TDWG: http://tdwg.org) Annual Conference in Montpellier, =20
France,
November 9-13, 2009.  The VoCamp is an activity of the TDWG Interest =20
Group
on Phylogenetics Standards (http://wiki.tdwg.org/Phylogenetics) and is
partly supported by TDWG and the Universit=E9 Montpellier.

GOALS AND ACTIVITIES
--------------------
The objective of the event is to connect previously disparate ontology
development efforts, stakeholder communities, and interoperability
initiatives with shared objectives. Aside from sharing knowledge, =20
expertise,
and best practices, our goal is to build-out existing ontology =20
resources in
a hands-on manner in terms of ontological rigor, semantic richness, and
modularity that supports effective reuse.

We also plan to have programming expertise and activities present at the
event, such as for necessary large-scale transformations, and =20
especially for
proof-of-concept applications that directly apply the ontologies being
developed.

On a long-term basis, we anticipate that the event, if successful, =20
will give
rise to similarly structured follow-up events organized by the =20
participating
stakeholder communities, such as TDWG, SONet
(http://sonet.ecoinformatics.org), and OBO (http://www.obofoundry.org).


ORGANIZATION
------------
The VoCamp will be 4 days in duration during November 7-11, 2009 and is
co-located with the TDWG annual conference
(http://www.tdwg.org/conference2009) in Montpellier, France.  The =20
first two
days (Nov 7-8) will be dedicated entirely to VoCamp and the remainder =20=

of the
event (Nov 10-11) will overlap with TDWG 'workshops days'.  Participants
will have the opportunity, and are encouraged, to interact with TDWG
participants and attend conference sessions outside of the VoCamp.

The specific vocabulary development targets will be selected by the
participants partly in advance through a dedicated area on a wiki, a =20
mailing
list, and one or more conference calls, and partly on-site through an =20=

Open
Space activity. The exact agenda for the event will be developed =20
similarly,
but will be largely devoted to ontology and vocabulary development =20
time. At
the event itself, participants will self-organize into small subgroups
focused on particular targets. The VoCamp will conclude with a wrap-up
session, and a report presented to the TDWG conference audience.

We also anticipate that several "boot camps" will be needed to ensure a
productive event for all participants, for example on ontology design =20=

and
engineering, reasoning, and infrastructure for collaborative =20
development of
ontologies.

We welcome comments and suggestions for issues in ontology development =20=

that
are not explicitly addressed here or in our proposal but that could be
addressed at the event. Please email the organizers at =
vocamp1@nescent.org
with any suggestions.


HOW TO APPLY
------------
The application consists of your cv and your responses to 6 questions =20=

about
your experience, skills, objectives, support, and commitment to open
software development. To apply, please fill out the online form at
http://bit.ly/VoCamp_Form by September 18, and submit your CV  to the
organizers at vocamp1@nescent.org. NESCent will provide funds in =20
support of
expenses, including travel, accommodation, registration, and meals. =20
Pending
the final amount of funds available and the support requested by the
participants, sponsorship may need to be capped.
Logistical and travel details will be communicated to accepted and =20
confirmed
participants.

We specifically encourage applications from members of under- =20
represented
groups, specifically women and minorities, and from graduate students =20=

and
post-docs.  If you have questions or are unsure whether to apply, please
contact an organizer or write to vocamp1@nescent.org .

Please understand that funding and space for this event are limited.
We also need to balance a critical mass of expertise in specific areas =20=

with
broad participation. Therefore, not all qualified applicants can be
guaranteed acceptance.

Yours,

The Organizing Committee

Registration is now open for the inaugural conference on Informatics  
for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://www.evolutionsociety.org/SSE2010/Register.html 
.

iEvoBio aims to bring together biologists working in evolution,  
systematics, and biodiversity, with software developers, and  
mathematicians, both to develop new tools, and to increase awareness  
of existing technologies (ranging from standards and reusable toolkits  
to mega-scale data analysis to rich visualization).

The 2-day meeting will take place June 29-30, 2010, in Portland, OR,  
jointly with the Evolution Meetings as a satellite conference.  The  
event will feature traditional elements, including a keynote  
presentation at the beginning of each day and contributed talks, as  
well as more dynamic and interactive elements, including a challenge,  
lightning talk-style sessions, a software bazaar, and Birds-of-a- 
Feather gatherings.

Attendees can register jointly for Evolution and iEvoBio at a  
discount, or only for the iEvoBio conference. For more information  
about registration, venue, travel, or accommodations visit the  
Evolution 2010 website at http://www.evolutionsociety.org/SSE2010/.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org. You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

The Call for Abstracts for full talks is now open for the inaugural  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/ 
2010. See below for instructions.

Accepted talks will be about 15-20 minutes in length and will be  
presented during the full talk sessions in the morning of each of the  
two conference days, following the day's keynote presentation.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at  
advancing research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity,  
including new tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data  
analysis, and visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long.  
The abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject.  As the  
number of program slots for full talks is limited, the abstract should  
give enough detail so reviewers can decide whether the submission  
merits a full talk or whether it should be moved to one of the  
lightning talk sessions.  If the subject of the talk is a specific  
software for use by the research community, the abstract must state  
the license and give the URL where the source code is available so  
reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.

The deadline for submission is April 8, 2010. We intend to notify  
authors of accepted talks before early registration for iEvoBio (and  
Evolution) ends. Further instructions for submission are at the  
following URL:
http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/information/presenters

Full talks are 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that iEvoBio will  
feature. The other 4 are: 1) Lightning talks (5 mins long), 2)  
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of- 
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries is already open  
(see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html), and information on how to  
contribute to the other 3 sessions is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

The iEvoBio 2010 Organizing Committee:
Rod Page (University of Glasgow)
Cecile Ane (University of Wisconsin at Madison)
Rob Guralnick (University of Colorado at Boulder)
Hilmar Lapp (NESCent)
Cynthia Parr (Encyclopedia of Life)
Michael Sanderson (University of Arizona)

(*) iEvoBio and its sponsors are dedicated to promoting the practice  
and philosophy of Open Source software development (see http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php) 
  and reuse within the research community. For this reason, if a  
submitted talk concerns a specific software system for use by the  
research community, that software must be licensed with a recognized  
Open Source License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be  
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file  
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control  
system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.  Authors of  
full talks who cannot meet this requirement at the time of submission  
should state their intentions, and are advised that the requirement  
must be met by June 27 at the latest.

PHYLOINFORMATICS SUMMER OF CODE 2010

http://hackathon.nescent.org/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2010

The Phyloinformatics Summer of Code program provides a unique  
opportunity for undergraduate, masters, and PhD students to obtain  
hands-on experience writing and extending open-source software for  
evolutionary informatics under the mentorship of experienced  
developers from around the world. The program is the participation of  
the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) as a mentoring  
organization in the Google Summer of Code(tm) (http://code.google.com/soc/ 
).

Students in the program will receive a stipend from Google (and  
possibly more importantly, a T-shirt solely available to successful  
participants), and may work from their home, or home institution, for  
the duration of the 3 month program. Each student will have at least  
one dedicated mentor to show them the ropes and help them complete  
their project.

NESCent is particularly targeting students interested in both  
evolutionary biology and software development. Initial project ideas  
are listed on the website. These range from phylogenetics pipeline  
development to a user interface for MIAPA-driven annotation of  
experiments, interactive animations of gene tree evolution, and  
rendering phylogenies on Google Earth. All project ideas are flexible  
and many can be adjusted in scope to match the skills of the student.   
We also welcome novel project ideas that dovetail with student  
interests.

TO APPLY: Apply online at the Google Summer of Code website (http://socghop.appspot.com/ 
), where you will also find GSoC  program rules and eligibility  
requirements.  The 12-day application period for students opens on  
Monday March 29th and runs through Friday, April 9th, 2010.

INQUIRIES: phylosoc {at} nescent {dot} org. We strongly encourage all  
interested students to get in touch with us with their ideas as early  
on as possible.

Hi all - sorry for the additional noise. The original email contained  
two errors: this is the 2010 program (not 2009, as the subject line  
said), and one URL was wrong. The corrected version is below for those  
who'd like to forward it on or print it out.

I'd also like to take the opportunity to highlight a few of our  
project ideas that pertain to biodiversity informatics and  
phylogenetic standards: #1, NeXML support in Bioruby; #6, building geo- 
phylogenies in Java; #10, a UI for MIAPA, the minimum reporting  
standard for phylogenetic analyses; and #15, Google Earth browser  
interface for TreeBASE.

The deadline for submitting abstracts for full talks to the inaugural  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio) has been extended by one week to Thursday,  
April 15, 2010. We hope that this will give those interested in  
contributing sufficient time to do so.

Please see http://bit.ly/iEvoBio_CfA for the full Call for Abstracts  
and author instructions. We still expect to be able to notify accepted  
talks in time for the early registration deadline of iEvoBio (and  
Evolution).

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/ 
iEvoBio, and there is a Google group you can join at http://groups.google.com/group/ievobio-announce 
  to receive announcements.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

The Call for Lightning Talks is now open for the inaugural conference  
on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity  
(iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010. See below  
for instructions.

Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes. They are ideal  
for drawing the attention of the audience to new developments, tools,  
and resources, or to subsequent events where more in-depth information  
can be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more information (http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning 
). Lightning talks will be part of the more interactive afternoon  
program on both conference days.

Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics aimed at  
advancing research in phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity,  
including new tools, cyberinfrastructure development, large-scale data  
analysis, and visualization.

Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1 page long.  
The abstract should provide an overview of the talk's subject.  
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the  
conference (see above). If applicable, the abstract must also state  
the license and give the URL where the source code is available so  
reviewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.

Review and acceptance of lightning talks will be on a rolling basis.  
The deadline for submission is the morning of the first day of the  
conference (June 29). Note that the number of lightning talk slots is  
finite, and given the high volume of submissions we experienced for  
full talks, the Lightning Talks track may fill up early. We cannot  
accept lightning talks until the open-source requirements are met, and  
so waiting with that until the deadline risks that the track is full  
by that time.

We ask all submitters of lightning talks to be willing to also serve  
as reviewers of such, as described above.

Lightning talks are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that  
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2)  
Challenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of- 
a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries remains open (see http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) 
, and information on the Software Bazaar and Birds-of-a-Feather  
sessions is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists

submitted talk concerns a specific software system for use by the  
research community, that software must be licensed with a recognized  
Open Source License (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/), and be  
available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file  
accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control  
system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.

The Call for Software Bazaar entries is now open for the inaugural  
conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/ 
2010. See below for instructions.

The Software Bazaar features presenters demonstrating their software  
live on a laptop. At iEvoBio, this session takes the place of a poster  
session, and will be between 1.5-2 hours in duration. Conference  
attendees will be able to walk from one demonstration to the next and  
open a conversation with the presenters.  Please also see our FAQ for  
this information (http://ievobio.org/faq.html#software). The Software  
Bazaar is part of the interactive afternoon program on the first  
conference day.

Entries should be software aimed at advancing research in  
phylogenetics, evolution, and biodiversity, and can include  
interactive visualizations that have been pre-computed (such as SVGs,  
or Google Earth-compatible KML files).

Submissions consist of a title, which will typically be the name of  
the software (or visualization method) being presented, the URL of a  
website where more information about the software can be obtained, and  
the license under which the source code is available. The provided  
website must contain a link to where the source code (and possibly  
binaries) can be downloaded. If it is not obvious from the provided  
website, the submission must describe what the software does.  
Reviewers will judge whether a submission is within scope of the  
conference (see above), and need to be able to verify whether the open- 
source requirement(*) is met.

Presenters are expected to bring their own laptops for presentation,  
and any auxiliary devices necessary (such as a mouse). Power will be  
available at the presentation tables (110V/60Hz, US-style plugs;  
international presenters need to bring a suitable adaptor). Please let  
the organizing committee know as much in advance as possible if you  
expect to have unusually high demands for wireless network bandwidth.  
Note that commercial marketing activities are not permitted -  
presenters wishing to promote commercial or proprietary services or  
products should contact the Evolution conference about exhibitor space.

Review and acceptance of Software Bazaar submissions will be on a  
rolling basis. The deadline for submission is the morning of the first  
day of the conference (June 29). As the number of Software Bazaar  
presentation slots is finite, we cannot guarantee the availability of  
slots up until the day of the conference. We cannot accept submissions  
until the open-source requirements are met.

We ask all submitters of Software Bazaar presentations to be willing  
to also serve as reviewers of such, as described above.

Softwar Bazaar demonstrations are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed  
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks  
(closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3) Challenge entries, and 4) Birds-of-a- 
Feather gatherings. The Calls for Challenge entries (http://ievobio.org/challenge.html 
) and Lightning Talks (same submission URL as above) remain open, and  
information on the Birds-of-a-Feather session is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used  
version control system like cvs, Subversion, git, Bazaar, or  
Mercurial.  Authors are advised that non-compliant submissions must be  
revised to meet the requirement by June 27 at the latest, and in the  
event that presentation slots run out, precedence is established by  
the date they are first found in compliance, not the date of submission.

This is a reminder that the Call for Challenge entries for the  
inaugural conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and  
Biodiversity (iEvoBio) closes in two weeks on June 21, 2010.

The theme of the 2010 iEvoBio conference challenge is "New  
visualization methods for evolutionary data". Visualizing evolution is  
a key part of our discipline and presents opportunities as much as it  
does obstacles. The iEvoBio Challenge is deliberately wide ranging:  
entries could range from geophylogenies to visualizing extremely large  
phylogenetic trees, to mashups showing relationships between lineages  
and other types of data (e.g. conservation status).

Further information on the nature of challenge entries and how to  
submit them can be found on the iEvoBio website at http://ievobio.org/challenge.html 
. Selected candidates will make short oral presentations to  
demonstrate their visualization in a "Challenge session" at the  
conference, and will automatically be entered into the Software Bazaar  
if suitable.

The winners of the Challenge will be judged collectively by the  
iEvoBio participants. There will be cash prizes for the first place  
($1,000) and runner up entries.

Challenge entries are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed content that  
iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2)  
Lightning talks, 3) Software Bazaar entries, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather  
gatherings. The Calls for Lightning Talks and Software Bazaar entries  
remain open (see http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/), and  
information on the Birds-of-a-Feather session is forthcoming.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  Continuous updates can also be  
found on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

In anticipation of the inaugural conference on Informatics for  
Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), we solicit all  
attendees to propose and discuss Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. See  
below for details.

Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings (BoFs) are informal, ad-hoc, focused  
face-to-face discussion groups that form around a shared interest.  
BoFs have a leader (usually, but not necessarily, the proposer) who  
initiates or moderates the discussion, but typically not a preset  
agenda. The topics of BoFs can range widely, including general  
cultural or computational infrastructure issues, or narrower questions  
such as how to make the best use of a particular software tool or how  
to solve a particular computational challenge.

Anyone willing to lead such a group can propose a BoF. iEvoBio will  
provide space that can accommodate up to 8-10 BoFs. Sign-up sheets  
will be provided on-site on the first day of the conference where  
attendees can propose a BoF or sign up for one proposed by someone  
else. BoFs will be about 1 hr in duration and take place in the  
afternoon of the second day of the conference.

In line with their informal nature, there is no official prior call  
for or submission of BoFs. However, we encourage those intending to  
propose one to sound out or rally potential attendees ahead of time.  
We suggest to employ Twitter (http://twitter.com) for this, using the  
#ievobioBof tag to mark BoF proposals and comments.

Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed  
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are: 1) Full talks  
(closed), 2) Lightning talks (waiting list only), 3) Challenge  
entries, and 4) Software Bazaar entries. The Calls for Challenge  
entries (http://ievobio.org/challenge.html) and Software Bazaar  
entries (http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010/) remain open.

More details about the program and guidelines for contributing content  
are available at http://ievobio.org.  You can also find continuous  
updates on the conference's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio.

iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary Synthesis Center  
(NESCent) in partnership with the Society of Systematic Biologists  
(SSB). Additional support has been provided by the Encyclopedia of  
Life (EOL).

Hi all,

we have reserved one full day for a Phylogenetics Standards hands-on  
activity at the upcoming TDWG conference. We asked for power strips  
and wireless network and tables that we can sit around and work  
together. The only thing that's missing right now is what exactly we  
should target. The options are wide open right now, with the two only  
major constraints being that (a) we have no funding this year to bring  
people in who wouldn't otherwise be there, and (b) abstract submission  
deadline is next Wednesday.

Any feedback or ideas, wild or not, that you have would be welcome -  
send those our way.

And BTW currently this workshops seems to be placed on the Wednesday  
of the conference week, so those of you blitzing the local biosphere  
will unfortunately have a conflict.

Cheers,
Nico & Hilmar

I'm sending this reply to only the tdwg-phylo list (sending to  
everyone seems like overkill).

Here are two ideas based on the use of phylogenies:

1.   For various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid  
species sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with  
the human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this  
typically isn't done and it's not always easy.  The goal of this  
project is to enable ordinary phylogenetics & systematics users to use  
current standards (Newick, NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species  
names (possibly other tax ids) with phylogenies in their usual  
workflows.  The focus is on developing short-term tools and strategies  
that might lead to better long-term solutions.  In some cases, its  
just a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly, possibly  
aided by better tools for data input.  For users whose workflows rely  
on Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids  
and tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of  
the other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or  
as complex as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the  
translation for you).

2.  There is a huge variety of tree viewers.  To some extent, users  
need this variety due to their having different feature sets.  But  
users shouldn't have to choose the viewer based on data format  
restrictions.  The goal of this project is to improve the usability of  
tree viewers.   Assess the interoperability (standards compatibility)  
of tree viewing software, develop strategies to improve it, and get  
started on any strategies that can be implemented.  Its not possible  
to modify viewers whose source code is unavailable, but there may be  
ways to work around this with scripts and translation tools.

Hi Arlin and others

 

I think that idea 1 below is a really valuable topic to address.  The
ability to link tree tips to other sources of data by taxon name or
identifier is a threshold  step for automating a whole range of analyses and
displays.  For example, the software I work on, Biodiverse
<http://www.purl.org/biodiverse/> , links phylogenies to species location
data for visualisation and analysis.  It would be great to have it running
automatically online, linking (for example) trees from treebase to
distributions from GBIF.  To do this (and many other things) however we need
a better solution to the taxon matching problem you describe.

 

cheers

Dan

I'm sending this reply to only the tdwg-phylo list (sending to everyone
seems like overkill). 

 

Here are two ideas based on the use of phylogenies: 

 

1.   For various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid
species sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with the
human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this typically isn't
done and it's not always easy.  The goal of this project is to enable
ordinary phylogenetics & systematics users to use current standards (Newick,
NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species names (possibly other tax ids) with
phylogenies in their usual workflows.  The focus is on developing short-term
tools and strategies that might lead to better long-term solutions.  In some
cases, its just a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly,
possibly aided by better tools for data input.  For users whose workflows
rely on Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids
and tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of the
other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or as complex
as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the translation for
you).   

 

2.  There is a huge variety of tree viewers.  To some extent, users need
this variety due to their having different feature sets.  But users
shouldn't have to choose the viewer based on data format restrictions.  The
goal of this project is to improve the usability of tree viewers.   Assess
the interoperability (standards compatibility) of tree viewing software,
develop strategies to improve it, and get started on any strategies that can
be implemented.  Its not possible to modify viewers whose source code is
unavailable, but there may be ways to work around this with scripts and

Hi all,

we have reserved one full day for a Phylogenetics Standards hands-on
activity at the upcoming TDWG conference. We asked for power strips and
wireless network and tables that we can sit around and work together. The
only thing that's missing right now is what exactly we should target. The
options are wide open right now, with the two only major constraints being
that (a) we have no funding this year to bring people in who wouldn't
otherwise be there, and (b) abstract submission deadline is next Wednesday.

Any feedback or ideas, wild or not, that you have would be welcome - send
those our way.

And BTW currently this workshops seems to be placed on the Wednesday of the
conference week, so those of you blitzing the local biosphere will
unfortunately have a conflict.

 

Cheers,

Nico & Hilmar

<p class=3DMsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<div>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>1. &nbsp; For various reasons, its important to be =
able to
associate valid species sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., =
NCBI gis)
with the human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this =
typically
isn't done and it's not always easy. &nbsp;The goal of this project is =
to
enable ordinary phylogenetics &amp; systematics users to use current =
standards
(Newick, NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species names (possibly other =
tax
ids) with phylogenies in their usual workflows. &nbsp;The focus is on
developing short-term tools and strategies that might lead to better =
long-term
solutions. &nbsp;In some cases, its just a matter of knowing how to use =
the
file format properly, possibly aided by better tools for data input. =
&nbsp;For
users whose workflows rely on Newick, we would need a way to keep a =
separate
mapping of OTU ids and tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or =
translate
to one of the other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel =
spreadsheet or
as complex as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the
translation for you). &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

</div>

<div>

<p class=3DMsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

</div>

<div>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>2. &nbsp;There is a huge variety of tree viewers. =
&nbsp;To
some extent, users need this variety due to their having different =
feature
sets. &nbsp;But users shouldn't have to choose the viewer based on data =
format
restrictions. &nbsp;The goal of this project is to improve the usability =
of
tree viewers. &nbsp; Assess the interoperability (standards =
compatibility) of
tree viewing software, develop strategies to improve it, and get started =
on any
strategies that can be implemented. &nbsp;Its not possible to modify =
viewers
whose source code is unavailable, but there may be ways to work around =
this
with scripts and translation tools. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid species =

human-readable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this typically =

to enable ordinary phylogenetics &amp; systematics users to use current =
standards (Newick, NHX, phyloxml, ...) to associate species names =
(possibly other tax ids) with phylogenies in their usual workflows. =

might lead to better long-term solutions. &nbsp;In some cases, its just =
a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly, possibly aided =
by better tools for data input. &nbsp;For users whose workflows rely on =
Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids and =
tax ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of the =
other formats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or as =
complex as a web service that maintains your mapping and does the =
translation for you). &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div></div><div><div =

Hi Arlin - I agree that this is an interesting project,. You're more  
than welcome to peruse the TDWG Phylo wiki to expand on this idea, and  
let me know if you encounter any trouble editing pages there.

Are you planning to be at the TDWG conference?

Regarding #1, and assuming that this concerns molecular data where individu=
als often function as OTUs, I think it would be even more important for the=
 long-term usefulness of the data to support the ability to reference the s=
pecimen with a resolvable GUID or at least a collection code and catalog nu=
mber.  A simple assertion that =93this sequence came from [an unknown speci=
men identified to be] this taxon=94 can=92t be re-examined or validated exc=
ept by the sequence data.  If you know what specimen it came from, the iden=
tification can be updated (by  more methods).

On the other hand, a full name backed up by a URL or source/GUID would be a=
 big improvement on codes and abbreviations

Here are two ideas based on the use of phylogenies:

1.   For various reasons, its important to be able to associate valid speci=
es sources or other universal identifiers (e.g., NCBI gis) with the human-r=
eadable OTU identifiers used in tree files, but this typically isn't done a=
nd it's not always easy.  The goal of this project is to enable ordinary ph=
ylogenetics & systematics users to use current standards (Newick, NHX, phyl=
oxml, ...) to associate species names (possibly other tax ids) with phyloge=
nies in their usual workflows.  The focus is on developing short-term tools=
 and strategies that might lead to better long-term solutions.  In some cas=
es, its just a matter of knowing how to use the file format properly, possi=
bly aided by better tools for data input.  For users whose workflows rely o=
n Newick, we would need a way to keep a separate mapping of OTU ids and tax=
 ids, along with tools to interconvert or translate to one of the other for=
mats (this could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet or as complex as a we=
b service that maintains your mapping and does the translation for you).

2.  There is a huge variety of tree viewers.  To some extent, users need th=
is variety due to their having different feature sets.  But users shouldn't=
 have to choose the viewer based on data format restrictions.  The goal of =
this project is to improve the usability of tree viewers.   Assess the inte=
roperability (standards compatibility) of tree viewing software, develop st=
rategies to improve it, and get started on any strategies that can be imple=
mented.  Its not possible to modify viewers whose source code is unavailabl=
e, but there may be ways to work around this with scripts and translation t=
ools.

The mapping can get complicated. At the level of taxa, one could do a =20=

one-to-one mapping of  TreeBASE taxa to NCBI taxa. At the level of =20
OTUs, the mapping may be one to many. An OTU may correspond to a =20
single specimen, a single sequence, or a set of sequences from =20
multiple individuals of the same taxon, or, indeed, a composite of =20
exemplar taxa representing a higher taxon. So, OTUs map onto sets of =20
observations.

Mapping OTUs to one or more specimen URIs would be great, if we had =20
these. But as a rule we don't. Most individual data providers don't =20
make individual specimens addressable. GBIF does, but we'd have to =20
assume that these were stable over time, and that we have tools in =20
place to map museum specimen codes to GBIF specimen URLs, and in =20
general we don't. This isn't a huge obstacle if GBIF were to provide =20
some guarantee that it's specimen URLs were stable, we'd then "just" =20
need some tools to convert "Museum addreviation specimen code xxx" to =20=

a URL.

My main aim is to support data integration (rather than validation),  
and the two most important integrating variables for the foreseeable  
future (at least in my limited vision) are species name (or other  
taxonomic identifier) and geographic coordinates.  These are important  
partly because the great mass of users outside of TDWG are committed  
to using the same kinds of species names and the same kinds of  
coordinates.

Most phylogeny information artefacts (e.g., files) out there don't  
have either one of these , so integrating phylogenetic information  
into the global web of data isn't going to get very far until we make  
it easy for users to put this information into their trees.

To the extent that the scientific community is committed in the same  
way to specimen identifiers, then this makes the problem simpler  
because the specimen source would become the integrating variable, and  
would mediate the integration of data by species or location (because  
the specimen would have a species and a location).  But I don't think  
we are there yet.

To build momentum for a possible working session on linking trees, I  
put some parts of this thread on the twiki page here:

   http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/LinkingTrees2010

This is one place to indicate your interest by adding your name and  
describing what you can bring to the workshop (in terms of both real- 
world problems and possible solutions).

All of you should be able to access the twiki using credentials that  
you established as a TDWG member.

Hi all -

thanks for everyone's input and the enthusiasm - very much  
appreciated! We tried to synthesize this and our own thoughts into an  
abstract. The resulting draft is here:

https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1ihH6MGKBCpH10sqvDK5ahLgvz6P_qP-TaN-vLt6O9j8

It is due for submission tomorrow, Sep 1, at  23:59 UTC which is (1  
minute before) 8pm US Eastern Time (if I understand the time zones the  
same way as TDWG does), so there's not a whole lot of time for  
changes. That said, please don't hesitate if you have any suggestions,  
and we aren't quite up to the 3,500 character limit yet, so adding on  
is still possible too.

	-Nico & Hilmar

Just FYI, we submitted the abstract yesterday. The URL below should

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-phylo,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-phylo into tdwg-content. The list tdwg-phylo will =
be closed and removed once the archives have been merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=

Markus and Lee -

I understand that there are lumpers and splitters in mailing list =20
design as much as in taxonomy. Similarly, there are benefits and =20
disadvantages to either.

We feel that we want to retain a mailing list that is the home for =20
communication of business of the =05Phylogenetic Standards Interest =20
Group, and where users know that traffic will be related only to that. =20=

That allows everyone to use their email filters to the best extent, =20
and to selectively subscribe to the traffic they want to subscribe to.

If you insist on merging or shutting down our mailing list against our =20=

declared will, we will move our business to a Google group.

I then also suggest that we have a public session at the TDWG =20
conference devoted to discussing this kind of unilateral decision =20
making over the heads of TDWG's interest group conveners. This is the =20=

first time ever as a IG convener hear about this. I was under the =20
impression that TDWG as an organization is committed to support and =20
empower their interest groups. What you are proposing here, and the =20
style of decision making and communication is the exact opposite of =20
that.

Hi Hilmar,

I'm not sure where Markus is, but Lee and Donald are asleep at the moment s=
o
I will step in and respond somewhat unilaterally.

I expect the wording in the original note should have been prefaced "If
there are are no objections..."  Your group clearly has an objection, so I
am confident that the phyloinformatics interest group mailing list will NOT
be merged.  Your understanding of TDWG's larger intentions -- to support th=
e
work of interest groups as best we can -- is correct.

A "discussion" of our mailing lists being over-partitioned and generally
very quiet went on over the last year (i.e., some time ago and not on the
phyloinformatics list).  It was a response to discussion on one list being
relevant to many and people finding it difficult to decide where to post an=
d
discussion evolving into topics relevant to many lists (Darwin Core, ABCD,
SDD, Geo-spatial, etc).  For those groups a merge worked well.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

-Stan

Thanks for your response Stan. I can't speak for other IGs and I can =20
imagine that for some (in fact know of at least one) the IG-specific =20
mailing list at TDWG may not serve a need that the group has. I think =20=

that's something that each IG needs to evaluate for themselves, and =20
hence my approach would have been to offer to each IG to do the =20
merging work for them if they chose to abandon their own list, rather =20=

than assuming that an issue for one group will also be one for =20
everyone else, and the way one group wants it dealt with will also be =20=

the one all other groups want.

There are, BTW, communities, such as OBO, that split almost =20
obsessively, and while that isn't exactly my preference either, it =20
does help with directing one's traffic where one wants it. Also, =20
systems like Google mail will automatically filter out duplicates from =20=

cross-posting. The bottom line from that is that it is better tools, =20
and working with the capabilities of those tools, that helps with =20
managing one's online communication, rather than having a single catch-=20=

all pot.
