Hello,

I had several people respond to my query about  what kinds of things we 
should discuss in this list. Overwhelmingly, the interest seemed focused on 
defining some of the key terms that we are bantering about. To that end I'd 
like to initiate the first discussion on this list by asking, what is an 
observation?
  What follows is some information that I gleaned from the Internet, 
discussions that I have had with others, and with the ENBI reports. I'd 
appreciate your comments, in our goal to create a good definintion of 
observation for our purposes.--Steve

Princeton University's Wordnet 
(<http://wordnet.princeton.edu/>http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) defines an 
observation as the act of making and then recording a measurement. 
Basically, something is watched, and notes are taken about it. In the study 
of biology and astronomy careful observations made by trained observations 
and amateurs alike, is the foundation of information gathered for these 
disciplines.


With regard to biodiversity informatics, particularly as to how 
observations relate to the existing infrastructure, the above definition is 
too general, because it encompasses all facets of biology. Consequently, we 
need to begin to qualify the definition of observation. First, we restrict 
our definition to only those observations made of organisms in the 
environment. Second, the location at which the observation was made is an 
integral component of the observation. Third, an observation is exclusive 
of museum voucher specimens. Finally, information collected during an 
observation includes additional attributes such as: protocol, measure of 
abundance, extent of occurrence, demographic, ecological associates, and 
environmental conditions.

  To discuss and ultimately added to the definition:

Advantages of observational data.
Disadvantages of observational data
Observational data providers (amateurs/professionals)
Detectability and data quality
Location specificity
Integration of observational data
Definition of a collecting event and its significance
others?

How about this:   An observation captures data about the occurrence of 
an organism in space and time and in relation to habitat and other 
organisms.  Documenting the precision, accuracy, certainty, and methods 
of the measurements that have been made during an observation is 
essential for determining the fitness for use of the data that has been 
captured. An observation is an event that can be linked to other events.

Indeed, I would like to emphasise the need of documenting what is called 
"quality".

What is an observation?

The essential elements of perhaps any observation were suggested by Rudyard
Kipling (1865-1936) in the Elephant's Child (1902): ("I keep six honest
serving-men (they taught me all I knew); their names are What and Why and
When and How and Where and Who").  Those elements answering Kipling's honest
serving-men are the basic observation elements.  

"What", makes reference to the species (specimens, from latin specere: "to
look at" or "to see"). 
"Where", represents the place where the samples are taken or observed and
some essential geographical features like Latitude, Longitude and Altitude. 
"Who", is the observer involved in the data gathering process. 
"How", the method used to get the observation including accuracy, tools,
quality control and assurance, precision and certainty.
"When", the observation's time, and 
"Why" is the context and purpose of the collection or observation.

I support Hannu's view.=20
=20
I still see a bit of confusion created by the overlap between 'a natural =
history oriented observations' and 'survey/monitoring observations'.=20
The former is generally a serendipitous event and is well described within =
ABCD. The latter generally places a much greater emphasis on recording the =
relationships between organisms and with the surrounding environment and =
the methodology used to capture these data.=20
Does the community see a difference between these two - or a continuum =
between them?=20
Is this group primarily concerned with the former, or the latter, or both?
If it is the former then I think I'm in the wrong group, and maybe we need =
a seprate group to consider survey/monitoring events.
If it is the latter, or a continuum, then I restate what I said in St =
Petersburgh. For survey/monitoring data it is the methodology metdata that =
takes precedence and that should act as a container for 1 to many =
observations of organisms and environmental variables. That is the inverse =
of say, Darwin Core, where an observation on a single organism takes =
precedence. Hence the difficulty in recording 'absence' data within a =
Darwin Core-like schema.

I fully agree with Jerry.  It may be helpful for us to start not by thinking
of observations by themselves, but rather to think of 'surveys' or some
other similar higher class of objects.  A 'survey' is a definition of the
protocols surrounding a set of 'observations' and is the correct place to
record all of the information about the methods involved, wherever that
falls along Jerry's hypothetical continuum.  Each 'observation' is then
associated with a 'survey'.  The most casual kind of 'observations' may be
associated with a null 'survey' indicating that little or nothing can be
inferred about the communities, populations and interactions of this and
other taxa in the given area on the basis of this isolated point event.

It is likely too that 'surveys' need the option of being defined recursively
to reflect the fact that a particular 'survey' may itself fit into a
higher-level organisation of coordinated activity.  For example a transect
may be part of an annual series for a given locality, within a national
scheme for monitoring a randomly selected set of transects.

The main point is that the interest in 'observations' is not exactly the
same as for specimens.  At an early stage in the development of GBIF, we
tended to treat observations as little more than voucherless specimens.
This ignores what is generally the most significant aspect of such data, the
organisation of those point events into a framework of observations in which
every observation (including every zero count) gives context to the others.
We need to focus on capturing this, rather than treating 'observation' data
simply as a set of modifier attributes to a standard Darwin Core taxon
occurrence record.

Subject: Re: [Tdwg-obs] What is an observation?

I support Hannu's view. 
 
I still see a bit of confusion created by the overlap between 'a natural
history oriented observations' and 'survey/monitoring observations'. 
The former is generally a serendipitous event and is well described within
ABCD. The latter generally places a much greater emphasis on recording the
relationships between organisms and with the surrounding environment and the
methodology used to capture these data. 
Does the community see a difference between these two - or a continuum
between them? 
Is this group primarily concerned with the former, or the latter, or both?
If it is the former then I think I'm in the wrong group, and maybe we need a
seprate group to consider survey/monitoring events.
If it is the latter, or a continuum, then I restate what I said in St
Petersburgh. For survey/monitoring data it is the methodology metdata that
takes precedence and that should act as a container for 1 to many
observations of organisms and environmental variables. That is the inverse
of say, Darwin Core, where an observation on a single organism takes
precedence. Hence the difficulty in recording 'absence' data within a Darwin
Core-like schema.

How about this:   An observation captures data about the occurrence of 
an organism in space and time and in relation to habitat and other 
organisms.  Documenting the precision, accuracy, certainty, and methods 
of the measurements that have been made during an observation is 
essential for determining the fitness for use of the data that has been 
captured. An observation is an event that can be linked to other events.

Indeed, I would like to emphasise the need of documenting what is called 
"quality".

1) Our definition of observation not be limited to only recording data =
(including images and sound) and allow for the possiblity of people =

2) The universe for our observations also include ecological / natural =

Hi all,
=20
I'm enclosing an email that Flip Dibner sent me during the TDWG meeting on =
the OGC effort in the area of 'observations and measurements'.
Follow the links below to the documentation.
I think they have come up a well though out  generalized model that =
encompasses most of the scenarios I can think of. Perhaps the only down =
side is the work necessary to pack/unpack data into this form, i.e. as a =
data exchange standard it looks great, but as an easily understandable =
working tool it looks heavy.

Donald et al.,

I also like Hannu's description overall, and believe (hope) that we are =
talking primarily about your second type of event (although there is a =
bit of a continuum).

This group was mostly created for describing observations used for the =
purpose of monitoring. We'll probably need to refine what constitute =
monitoring as well, but to me, it implies following the status of an =
organism's population in space and/or time by using repeated =
observations. I'm sure someone can come up with a better definition, but =
the single isolated observation record in itself as little value outside =
of the context of monitoring.

The issue that you raise regarding the main unit element of the schema =
is a critical one, and one that I've been trying to get across from =
early on. The issue of negative data is the single most important =
distinction between monitoring and collection data. Knowing that an =
organism was not detected is equally as important as knowing that it =
was, and this is sometimes a difficult concept to get across to people =
outside of the monitoring world.

Darwin Core is indeed focussed on individual records, and I've been =
somewhat reluctant to using a flat schema like this to describe =
monitoring data, which really has at least 2 layers (sampling event and =
observation of organisms within each sampling event). The approach that =
the bird community is currently pushing in North America is to use a =
flat schema that is an extension of DarwinCore, but have the client =
generate 2 queries to normalize the flat records into 2 pieces. A first =
query that summarize the monitoring events (the HOW, WHEN, WHERE, WHO =
fields described by Alvaro), and a second query that gathers the related =
individual observations made during those events (the WHAT). (The WHY is =
yet a 3rd layer that is found in the metadata).

The main caveat with that approach is for the case where you have a =
monitoring event that did not have ANY observation at all (hence you do =
not have a record to generate a monitoring event in your first query). =
This is typically rare with birds surveys, but it may be more common in =
protocols that are looking at a limited suite of species. The way we've =
been handling this is by having a field that we called NoObservation. =
Any event that has zero observation is required to have at least one =
record with this field set to "Yes", and no other taxonomic information. =


The alternative approaches that we had considered were to 1) use a =
hierarchical schema or 2) to use multiple schemas (one for the events, =
one for the observations) with a link connecting the two. The main =
reason to go with the DarwinCore approach is it's simplicity for =
providers, and the expertise that people have developed around that =
schema, DiGIR and everything around it.=20

I think DarwinCore is well adapted already to describe the WHEN, WHERE, =
WHO and WHAT, but not so much the HOW (protocol) and WHY (metadata). The =
current WHEN and WHERE fields are also lacking information that allow to =
determine effort (duration, area, etc.). These additional pieces are all =
critical in the context of monitoring, and this is where we've focussed =
or effort to extend DarwinCore. We've posted the list of extension =
fields to DarwinCore here, although they may still continue to evolve a =
bit: http://www.avianknowledge.net/dataFederation/BMDE%20Schema%20Tabls=20

So, all this to say that we need to include the concept of monitoring in =
our definition.=20

Denis,

Note that you can probably get away with a flat Darwin Core-like model =
if
you are prepared to model objects of different types.  A flat schema (or =
set
of schemas) can describe a specimen and include an attribute which =
stores an
identifier (GUID) for an object of a different class which represents =
the
monitoring regime.  We need to make sure that we build systems and tools
that make it simple to retrieve objects of different classes easily.

Subject: Re: [Tdwg-obs] What is an observation?

Donald et al.,

I also like Hannu's description overall, and believe (hope) that we are
talking primarily about your second type of event (although there is a =
bit
of a continuum).

This group was mostly created for describing observations used for the
purpose of monitoring. We'll probably need to refine what constitute
monitoring as well, but to me, it implies following the status of an
organism's population in space and/or time by using repeated =
observations.
I'm sure someone can come up with a better definition, but the single
isolated observation record in itself as little value outside of the =
context
of monitoring.

The issue that you raise regarding the main unit element of the schema =
is a
critical one, and one that I've been trying to get across from early on. =
The
issue of negative data is the single most important distinction between
monitoring and collection data. Knowing that an organism was not =
detected is
equally as important as knowing that it was, and this is sometimes a
difficult concept to get across to people outside of the monitoring =
world.

Darwin Core is indeed focussed on individual records, and I've been =
somewhat
reluctant to using a flat schema like this to describe monitoring data,
which really has at least 2 layers (sampling event and observation of
organisms within each sampling event). The approach that the bird =
community
is currently pushing in North America is to use a flat schema that is an
extension of DarwinCore, but have the client generate 2 queries to =
normalize
the flat records into 2 pieces. A first query that summarize the =
monitoring
events (the HOW, WHEN, WHERE, WHO fields described by Alvaro), and a =
second
query that gathers the related individual observations made during those
events (the WHAT). (The WHY is yet a 3rd layer that is found in the
metadata).

The main caveat with that approach is for the case where you have a
monitoring event that did not have ANY observation at all (hence you do =
not
have a record to generate a monitoring event in your first query). This =
is
typically rare with birds surveys, but it may be more common in =
protocols
that are looking at a limited suite of species. The way we've been =
handling
this is by having a field that we called NoObservation. Any event that =
has
zero observation is required to have at least one record with this field =
set
to "Yes", and no other taxonomic information.=20

The alternative approaches that we had considered were to 1) use a
hierarchical schema or 2) to use multiple schemas (one for the events, =
one
for the observations) with a link connecting the two. The main reason to =
go
with the DarwinCore approach is it's simplicity for providers, and the
expertise that people have developed around that schema, DiGIR and
everything around it.=20

I think DarwinCore is well adapted already to describe the WHEN, WHERE, =
WHO
and WHAT, but not so much the HOW (protocol) and WHY (metadata). The =
current
WHEN and WHERE fields are also lacking information that allow to =
determine
effort (duration, area, etc.). These additional pieces are all critical =
in
the context of monitoring, and this is where we've focussed or effort to
extend DarwinCore. We've posted the list of extension fields to =
DarwinCore
here, although they may still continue to evolve a bit:
http://www.avianknowledge.net/dataFederation/BMDE%20Schema%20Tabls=20

So, all this to say that we need to include the concept of monitoring in =
our
definition.=20

Hello,

I appreciate all of the thoughtful comments regarding the question of what 
is an observation. My rational for starting at an observation and not a 
monitoring event or some higher level was to make sure that we had a clear 
definition of the primary unit of observational data. It is this unit that 
can be (and is) integrated with existing natural history collections 
information, and is the main determinant of why observational data should 
be included with current initiatives. Walter Berendsohn's, Hannu 
Saarenmaa's, and the OGC Observations and Measurements white paper give us 
a good starting point. From these I suggest the following:


Definition of Observation: An observation is a collection event that 
describes a phenomenon, and is bound to the spatiotemporal location where 
it was made. Furthermore, an observation describes an occurrence and can be 
linked to descriptions of other occurrences.


Once this definition is established, and agreed upon, then this subgroup 
can assert what is unique about observational data. This pertains to the 
second aspect of Hannu's suggestion, what Jerry Cooper refers to as the 
latter or continuum option, and what Denis Lepage discusses in detail. 
Specifically, we can now discuss the fundamental organization unit of 
observational data: the collection event. In the description of the 
collection event we begin to address issues of data quality, protocols, 
extent, precision, accuracy, certainty, protocol methodology, negative or 
absence data, and other issues.

Greetings,
             I apologize for the delay in posting to the listserve. As I am 
sure it is true for you, it has been quite hectic for me.

             My feeling is that we have a good definition for the 
integrative element of observational data. That is, the element in which 
observational data can be (and is) incorporated in existing Natural History 
collections data. To reiterate;
An observation is a collection event that describes a phenomenon, and is 
bound to the spatiotemporal location where it was made. Furthermore, an 
observation describes an occurrence and can be linked to descriptions of 
other occurrences.
             Now we can begin to talk about the methods of aggregating 
observations. To do this means issues such as protocol (including 
precision, accuracy, and certainty in the methods), data quality, inferring 
negative data, and detectability must be addressed. It is at this point 
where observational data can begin to contribute and extend the value of 
the data held within biodiversity data networks.

             What I would like to do is begin a discussion on 
survey/monitoring techniques and issues. Specifically I would like to 
develop the necessary requirements to define methodology metadata. For 
example, how does one distinguish between surveys and monitoring? For 
example, I consider monitoring as a protocol- driven collection of 
observational data gathered repeatedly over a time series at a specific 
location. Thus, I would distinguish monitoring from a survey in that a 
survey documents an occurrence of an organism(s) at a location at a 
particular time, and does not include repeated sampling.

Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi all - Hopefully a quick question / clarification. =20

I was wondering if the definition below  " ... the element in which
observational data can be (and is) incorporated in existing Natural
History collections data ... " also includes ecological / natural
communities in addition to organisms? There is quite a wealth of
information being collected at this broader more "habitat" level.  If
these type of data are implicitly covered, is there a need for clarity
to explicitly state that observations include ecological communities in
addition to organisms?

Thanks -=20

Hello,

Like Lynn, I would like the observations standard to support observations 
of communities as well as individual organisms

Consider the VegBank approach
(http://vegbank.org/vegdocs/design/erd/vegbank_erd.pdf):

A vegetation plot (location) can have multiple plotObservation events, 
each of which can have multiple taxonObservation events (collectively such 
as density, or of individuals), each of which can have multiple 
identification events, each of which can refer to multiple taxonomic 
concepts.  In addition, the plotObservation can have multiple 
identifications, and each of these can refer to multiple community 
concepts.

With this approach permanent information about the location, such as 
geocoordinates, is associated with the plot.  Transient information about 
the plot is recorded with the plotObservation and here we also could refer 
to protocols applied. Monitoring can be handled by a recursive loop 
linking plotObservations or taxonObservations

Hello,
The definition for the fundamental unit of observational data can certainly 
include the community concept that Lynn points out. The choice of the term 
phenomenon, instead of taxon allows for this. I believe that Bob Peet's 
comments are going to be important in the discussion of aggregating 
observational data into collecting events (i.e. surveys/monitoring). 
Vegetation blocks are analogous in bird monitoring to point count transects 
(the most well known of these in the United States is the Breeding Bird 
Survey) During a point count transect  multiple species (and numbers of 
individuals) are recorded during each point count during the survey (with 
BBS there are 50 such point counts). It will be very important that we 
address how we can organize and/or aggregate point counts or vegetation 
plot surveys as we incorporate observational data into the general 
Biodiversity informatics community.

"An observation is a collection event that describes a phenomenon, and is
  bound to the spatiotemporal location where it was made. Furthermore, an
  observation describes an occurrence and can be linked to descriptions of
  other occurrences."

Regards,
Steve

Good support for plot observations is important, because that is how the 
forestry community manages their data. If they can identify their own 
concepts in this standard, that willl potentially open access to a very 
large number of databases.  Forest plots are not really different from 
vegetation plots, as described below by Bob.  The most notable addition 
would be measurements of diameter, height, etc. These may not have 
direct relevance for biodiversity studies but in order to find 
acceptance from the forestry community, I think it would be advantageous 
to design an easy mechanism for linking such data to the plot 
observation data.  In forest surveys there also often are observations 
on harmful agents (insects, etc.) that would be linked to some of the 
tree cohorts in a plot.

I would agree with Hannu, but there will be many other like communities that will have different types of survey requirements as well.

What I believe would be worth while would be for a central standard for observations and basic/minimal survey information, with the ability to have small specific extensions for specialised surveys (forestry, marine, fresh water aquatic fish, etc.) that will each have specific requirements.  

As I would see it, the Observation Standard would be the common-denominator fields that could be appended by extra community-specific fields as appropriate.

Hi everyone,

Sorry for throwing a spike in the wheel, but I'm not sure I like the =
current definition of what constitute an observation, and I think we =
need to get it right.

"An observation is a collection event that describes a phenomenon, and =
is bound to the spatiotemporal location where it was made. Furthermore, =
an observation describes an occurrence and can be linked to descriptions =
of other occurrences."=20

1) I tend to find the word "phenomenon" too vague in the first part of =
our definition. The main phenomenon we're trying to observe is the =
occurrence (or the absence) of one or more organisms. I'm not sure what =
other phenomena we're trying to include here?=20

2) I'm also a bit puzzled by the fact that an observation is defined as =
the collection event. It seems to me that multiple observations are made =
during a collection event, and that the 2 are different things.=20

Here's an attempt to address my 2 points with a new definition.=20

"An observation is the characterization of the occurrence of an organism =
through a collection event with a defined protocol and spatiotemporal =
location. Individual observations are non-independant entities that can =
be linked to each other through their common characteristics."

Denis

p.s. I agree with Arthur Chapman's comments about including =
community-specific information into extensions of the main observation =
schema. Keeping the core schema small will be the biggest challenge we =
face, since we deal with a multitude of needs from various communities.=20

Overall I like the direction of Denis's proposed definition, but I have =
a comment and a question.

Comment - I propose to explicitly expand the definition of an obervation =
to include both organisms and ecological communities (such as =
vegetation).

And a question - does the "defined protocol" need to be a published =
document, or can the protocol be more informal? I think that the =
observer should provide some minimal documentation of how they made that =
particular spatiotemporal observation, but I'd imagine there's quite a =
bit of high quality observation in existence that was collected =
opportunistically and not necessarily using a published protocol.=20

Thanks -=20

Hi again,

I think Steve's point about aggregating data is a critical one. When you =
have a unique data source, you have a lot more control over issues such =
as protocol, effort, data quality, etc. In a distributed data =
environment, you need to be able to make the assesment about the data =
you are using as a data analyst.=20

This always comes down to the issue of what questions you want to ask of =
your data. The goal is not necessarily to describe all data, but to =
share data for particular purposes. If you are talking about population =
monitoring, anything that will affect your chances of detecting a =
particular organism during an event is potentially of interest to the =
analyst. I think we'll need to take on one piece at a time, at the risk =
of being overwhelmed. Here's an attempt to summarize the main issues at =
hand:

- data quality/uncertainty (what are the parameters needed to describe =
it, and how do they differ among different communities). Some of it is a =
property of the protocol (eg, citizen-science vs. professional =
biologists), and some is a property of individual observations. Both are =
important.

- protocol (what are the parameters needed to describe it, and how do =
they differ among communities). Protocol issues include how to measure =
effort (for how long did you observe, how big an area did you cover), =
taxonomic focus (what are the taxa of interest? all birds? all aquatic =
invertebrates? all waterfowl? all raptors?), and more.

- sampling framework (is this a stratified survey, what are your strata, =
etc.).  This is somewhat related to protocol, but you may also need =
information about individual strata (size, etc.).

- ancillary data (eg, environmental data, weather, water chemistry, etc. =
or community-specific information about the organisms, such as fat score =
for birds). Which ones are important, and most importantly, to answer =
what specific questions? This is probably the most complex aspect of =
having multiple communities involved. A lot of this will probably =
require specific extensions.

- I'm not sure how we can describe detectability in a data schema. This =
may be more something you want to be sure that you can measure from the =
data itself. If so, what are the components needed to do so?

- are there other topics?=20

I think we've made some progress already within the bird community on =
many of those fronts with the BMDE schema, but there's still some work =
to do, especially on the protocol description standards. Not sure what =
the best way to go about making progress on those things is for the =
larger monitoring community.=20

What about building a dictionnary of monitoring protocols that we can =
refer to from the data schema? If each protocol had a unique ID, and =
this information was available somewhere outside of the data schema, it =
would probably simplify things immensely. The data schema would still =
need to have some protocol information (eg, if the duration varies among =
individual events following a given protocol). Were you thinking about =
something along those lines, Steve?

Good night
Denis

Here's a slight change that might work: "An observation is the =

No, defined protocol didn't imply a scientifically rigorous one or a =

The discussion so far has been right on, but I'd like to add a few more 
comments about ecological surveys and monitoring.  So far the emphasis 
has been on single, identifiable species.  I fully agree with Lynn's 
comment that we also need an emphasis on identification of organisms to 
higher taxonomic ranks, functional groupings, life-history stages, and 
other ecological classifications.

In ecological survey work there is always a tradeoff between sampling 
extent and intensity, and that often results in a desire to lower effort 
per sample via either using reduced precision in identification or by 
using various subsampling techniques.

Observers don't always identify organisms to species, or they may use 
functional groupings or other ecological classifications for their 
identifications.  I've seen this with people that sample zooplankton 
(many copepods are extremely difficult to identify efficiently), 
intertidal invertebrates and algae, and forest mosses, among many others.

In addition, within a single sampling location (e.g., a plot or quadrat) 
  sampling effort often varies depending on the species or maybe some 
life history stage. For example, in some forest survey work I've done 
the trees above a certain size class are censused, geolocated, and 
characterized fully, while below the size cutoff they are only counted. 
  Shrubs, saplings, and seedlings may be treated differently, and 
subsampling may vary among species.  Seedlings of abundant species may 
be subsampled more than rare species to save time.  As a consequence, 
any standard needs to be able to associate spatial sampling designs and 
subsampling procedures with both taxonomic and other distinguishing 
characteristics of the sampled community.  This means that records 
within a sampling unit (e.g., a plot) and within a species may be 
collected using different protocols.

Finally, some methods for estimating abundance (e.g., percent cover) 
frequently also count non-organismal features such as substrate (soil, 
rock, etc).  In both the intertidal zone and forests, surveys might 
include % cover of sessile organisms as well as bare rock or other 
substrates, and the totals may not add up to 100% where there is 3d 
structure.  I think we need to accomodate these other categories as they 
are critical for analyzing coverage data as it is commonly collected.

Enjoying the discussion,
Matt

Hello,

I think that the issues being brought up around the proposed definition of 
an observation, and the subsequent discussions and proposed modifications 
of the definition have been illuminating. The result, I believe, is that we 
are creating a more useful definition of an observation. I do want to make 
a couple of points.

First, what we are trying to define is the fundamental datum, or fixed 
reference point from which observational data can be integrated with data 
from other biodiversity initiatives such as the organization of museum 
specimen collections. I agree with Denis that in order to accomplish this 
we must be able to define the "core elements" of an observation. 
Consequently, this definition only needs to recognize protocols, sampling 
area, quality etc. Addressing these issues are the next step and Matt's 
comments are right on.

Second, Lynn's comment about the inclusion of ecological communities is 
extremely important for the same reasons that aggregation of observational 
data are. These two points have a major impact on how biodiversity 
informatics, particularly international efforts such as TDWG and GBIF 
organize and present information. These concepts move away from the 
specimen as the foundation of organization. For example, the community 
concept is based on species assemblages (instead of a single species), are 
well embraced by other ecological organizing initiatives as Bob Peet points 
out, and necessitates a change in organizational schemas. Furthermore, 
aggregating observations into collecting events changes the hierarchical 
structure of organizational schemas, because the collecting event and not 
the individual species record is the principal focus.

I suggest that we go with the definition of an observation as:

An observation characterizes the occurrence of an organism (or a community 
of organisms) through a collection event using a defined protocol and 
spatiotemporal location. Individual observations are non-independent 
entities that can be linked to each other through their common characteristics.

If this group agrees with this I will post it on the TDWG observational 
monitoring web page.

Hi Steve,

Try the folllowing revision, which is in part an exercise to see whether I 
understand your definition.

"An observation characterizes the occurrence of an organism or set of 
organisms through a data collection event using a defined protocol at a 
defined spatiotemporal location. Individual observations are not 
necessarily independent entities and potentially can be linked through 
common characteristics such as time, place, protocol, and individual 
organisms."

specimen as the foundation of organization. For example, the community=20
concept is based on species assemblages (instead of a single species), =
are=20
well embraced by other ecological organizing initiatives as Bob Peet =
points=20
out, and necessitates a change in organizational schemas. Furthermore,=20
aggregating observations into collecting events changes the hierarchical=20=

structure of organizational schemas, because the collecting event and =
not=20
the individual species record is the principal focus.

I suggest that we go with the definition of an observation as:

An observation characterizes the occurrence of an organism (or a =
community=20
of organisms) through a collection event using a defined protocol and=20
spatiotemporal location. Individual observations are non-independent=20
entities that can be linked to each other through their common characterist=
ics.

If this group agrees with this I will post it on the TDWG observational=20
monitoring web page.

Hi all -=20

I think we're really close ... But I have a couple of questions and a
suggested minor rewording. I forwarded Bob Peet's definition to several
NatureServe staff, member programs, and partners who work with
observation data. The following reflects the compiled comments from
several people.

There was concern that including "defined protocol" in the definition of
observation could be overly restrictive and prevent the inclusion in an
observation data repository of high quality / high confidence
information that was collected opportunistically and not as part of an
official survey with a protocol. For example - a biologist out doing a
bird survey happens upon some scat or tracks that he/she recognizes as a
species of interest to his/her (say, wolverine) and records the GPS
coordinates and some basic information about the date/time and location.
Would this be acceptable for an observations system? Would it be
acceptable to indicate the protocol as "none" or something similar?

We'd like to propose adding some language to incorporate explicit
tracking of negative data. These would be data where a survey was
conducted for a certain species (such as a rare orchid) in an area where
it would be expected to be found, and the observer wants to document and
communicate that information to inform future survey efforts,
distribution mapping efforts, and activities such as conservation
planning. This would be different from inferring negative data as is
sometimes done with bird observation data.

Also - does the "defined spatiotemporal location" need to be highly
precise, or can it be defined generally (with spatiotemporal uncertainty
as needed) to reflect knowledge of the observation or observer? For
example - include imprecise dates (e.g. spring 1998) and locations (3
miles SW of the intersection of Clear Creek and Main Road)?

So ... With the above as background, what do people think of the
following tinkering with Bob's suggested definition:

"An observation characterizes the occurrence, or documents the lack of
occurrence, of an organism or set of organisms through a data collection
event at a location.  Individual observations are not necessarily
independent entities and potentially can be linked through common
characteristics such as time, place, protocol, and co-occurring
organisms."=20


Thanks -=20

I like this definition.

I think it is important we recognise absences - a key reason for looking at observation data from my view.  Also, I can see many uses for the opportunistic occurence that Lynn mentions.

Hello,
I really like comments that Lynn has brought, and appreciate that she 
forwarded the definition around NatureServe. I do have a couple of 
comments, which are found in the text below.

At 06:36 PM 11/22/2005 -0500, you wrote:

While in some ways I feel that it is good to include a protocol in the 
definition, I can agree that it is not really essential in a primary 
definition of an observation. My reason is that in the NA bird monitoring 
community, even opportunistic observations are considered a protocol. These 
are characterized as opportunistic or incidental observations. Furthermore, 
in our development of the a data exchange schema for bird monitoring data 
the variable protocol figured prominently.  So, while not part of the 
definition, I suggest that we make sure to spend some time on a discussion 
of protocols in future discussions.

I think that this is a good idea. The concept of negative data is an 
important one, with a variety of different angles. But, as with protocol I 
don't believe that it is absolutely essential in our definition. My feeling 
is that the way we use occurrence in the definition does not infer only 
positive observations. So, I suggest that we do not include this, but again 
spend quite a bit of time on this topic as we expand and explore the basic 
definition.

Yes, I believe that we can be less explicit on the location. So having more 
vague terminology in the definition is a good thing.

Finally, I always feel that a definition should strive to get its message 
across in as few a words as possible. So, I might suggest:

"An observation characterizes the occurrence of an organism or set of 
organisms through a data collection event at a location.  An observation is 
not necessarily an independent entity and could be linked via 
characteristics such as time, place, protocol, and co-occurring organisms."

The words or phrases in bold in the definition need to be developed more 
fully. As we work through the definitions of these words and phrases I 
believe that issues being brought up such as negative data, protocol, 
spatial temporal issues, and data aggregation can be addressed.

Regards,

A belated happy new years to all!
=20
It's been quite awhile since the last post to the TDWG-observations
list, so I have included at the bottom the previous message as a
reminder of where we are in the discussion about a working definition
for "observation".
=20
In the interim, I discussed directly with Steve a minor edit to make the
wording in the second sentence of the observation definition plural.
Steve liked this edit, so we propose the following as our working
definition for the observation subgroup:

"An observation characterizes the occurrence of an organism or set of
organisms through a data collection event at a location. Observations
are not necessarily independent entities and could be linked via
characteristics such as time, place, protocol, and co-occurring
organisms."

As a next step, we propose to develop more fully the definitions for the
following words or phrases. As we we work through these definitions,
please keep in mind addressing the issues that have been raised
regarding topics such as: negative data, protocol, spatial temporal
issues, and data aggregation.

        occurrence

        data collection event=20

        location

        entity

        could be linked=20

We thought it best to start with fleshing out the definition for
"occurrence" since that seems to be fundamental. I did some searching
for existing definitions of "occurrence" in a biological context and it
seems to most often be a word that is used with the assumption that
everybody is working from a common frame of reference.=20

The following is from:

Chapman, A. D. 2005. Principles of Data Quality, version 1.0. Report for
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Copenhagen.

(http://www.gbif.org/prog/digit/data_quality)

Species-occurrence data

Species-occurrence data is used here to include specimen label data
attached to specimens or lots housed in museums and herbaria,
observational data and environmental survey data. In general, the data
are what we term "point-based", although line (transect data from
environmental surveys, collections along a river), polygon (observations
from within a defined area such as a national park) and grid data
(observations or survey records from a regular grid) are also included.
In general we are talking about georeferenced data - i.e. records with
geographic references that tie them to a particular place in space -
whether with a georeferenced coordinate (e.g. latitude and longitude,
UTM) or not (textual description of a locality, altitude, depth) - and
time (date, time of day). In general the data are also tied to a
taxonomic name, but unidentified collections may also be included. The
term has occasionally been used interchangeably with the term "primary
species data".

Primary species data

"Primary species data" is used to describe raw collection data and data
without any spatial attributes. It includes taxonomic and nomenclatural
data without spatial attributes, such as names, taxa and taxonomic
concepts without associated geographic references.

Thoughts or suggestions on a working definition of "occurrence" for this

Lynn

Pity we didn't have this discussion before I wrote that.

We used the term "Species Occurrence Data" after lots of discussion and arguments over what we are really talking about. People argued against "biodiversity data", "Primary Species Data" "Species Collection Data" and many more.  Some still do not like the term "Species Occurrence Data", but personally I think it does cover most of the what we are talking about. 

I look forward to this discussion and hope that my definition is not too far off the mark.  Of course "Occurrence" may have a different definition when separated from "species".

Perhaps change "occurrence" to "evidence for the presence or absence"?

The key idea is that the organism or set of organisms was either detected 
or not.  We also need to provide an opportunity for the recorder to note 
the certainly.

As an aside, recall we need to support minimalist protocols (e.g. 
"organism/community (not)seen in field", "organism heard in field", "scat 
seen in field", "tracks seen in field", "museum collection".)

>        data collection event
= An event, during or after which at least the minimum required data 
were recorded.

>        location
Ideally, at least geocoordinates plus an accuracy term.  We may wish to 
support such primitive location indicators as place names, but this is 
dangerous and I would prefer to require translation of names into 
geocoordinates and precision.

The geocoordinates should also be allowed to be associated with a set of 
points that define the edges of an area, or other spatial metadata.

>        entity
Deletion of this word from the definition might help

>        could be linked
= can have a pointer or pointers to other observations, thereby creating 
aggregate observations.  Note that commonality of date, time, place, etc. 
is not sufficient in that the none of the observation authors explicitly 
made the connection

I agree with most of what you say Robert

I like removing occurrence altogether from the definition and your words are good.

I diagree with your comments on localition, however. Ideally - yes, encourage georeferences, but we cannot exclude observations (especially historic ones) that do not presently have a georeference.

I am at present preparing a document on 'Best Practices for Georeferencing' as part of the BioGeomancer project. (http://www.biogeomancer.org).  BioGeomancer is preparing tools to assist in georeferencing legacy data, etc. and the Best Practices document will include information on how to collect locality data in the field.  It will also have a lot of information on how to calculate Uncertainty and error in location records. We can encourage all new collections and observations to have georeference information, but for legacy data this will not always be possible.   

agree on entities - I don't think we lose anything by removing it.

Cheers

With only comments from Bob & Arthur (thanks!), the latest version of
observation definitions is as follows:

"An observation characterizes the evidence for the presence or absence
of an organism or set of organisms through a data collection event at a
location. Observations are not necessarily independent and could be
linked via characteristics such as time, place, protocol, and
co-occurring organisms."=20

With the following draft elaborations for various terms (many thanks to
Bob Peet for providing most of these draft definitions):

1) occurrence

"Occurrence" has been changed to "evidence for the presence or absence".

The key idea is that the organism or set of organisms was either
detected or not.  We also need to provide an opportunity for the
recorder to note the certainty.

As an aside, recall we need to support minimalist protocols (e.g.
"organism/community (not)seen in field", "organism heard in field",
"scat seen in field", "tracks seen in field", "museum collection".)

2) data collection event

An event, during or after which at least the minimum required data were
recorded.

3) location

Ideally, at least geocoordinates plus an accuracy term. Since there is a
considerable amount of historical / legacy data that does not presently
have a georeference yet has valuable information that should be included
in observation databases and shared, we cannot at this time require data
to be in a GIS format.=20

I (Lynn) suggest:=20
(a) Location information be required, preferably geocoordinates and
mapping precision, but if not available then a text description and the
finest level of geolocation using the Darwin Core attributes.

(b) Location data include the representation of observations as point,
line, or polygon data (with the necessary spatial metadata).

4) entity

Dropped from the definition of observation.

5) could be linked

Can have a pointer or pointers to other observations, thereby creating
aggregate observations.  Note that commonality of date, time, place,
etc. is not sufficient in that the none of the observation authors
explicitly made the connection


Please share your comments / thoughts on all of the above definitions
with this email list.

If people are generally comfortable with the above as working
defintions, then I'd like to propose that we move into the fun part of
identifying attributes to be developed into a schema.

Thank you -=20

Lynn, I am reasonably happy with definition.

The word 'protocol'  what does this mean in this context?

In your Locality definition a).  I don't think you mean Mapping Precision here - it is only one aspect of accuracy/uncertainy.  Also - not all coordinates will be attached to a map (e.g. GPS).  I prefer any of the the terms 'Uncertainty', 'Accuracy' or 'Maximum Error' (or all three/four with Precision).  They are all slightly different in meaning.

My other suggestion revolves around the mention of Darwin Core here - is it necessary - some may be using ABCD, etc. and should we necessarily have the definition tied to a protocol

Suggest: 

(a) Location information be required, preferably geocoordinates and
a record of uncertainty (using accuracy, maximum error or mapping precision as appropriate), but if not available then a text description and the
finest level of geolocation possible.

With b) Is it worth also adding grid to point, line and polygon.  I know that one grid can be included as a polygon, but it does infer a regular shape, and is perhaps one of the most used recording mechanisms for observational data.

I don't quite get what you mean by "Note that commonality of date, time, place,
etc. is not sufficient in that none of the observation authors
explicitly made the connection".  This needs rewording.

Cheers

Arthur

"set of organisms" doesn't sound very natural to me. What about "group of organisms"?  However, doesn't the second sentence covers this anyway?

Hello,
I really like the improvements made on the definition, and I might suggest 
that I put it up on the TDWG-obs website http://www.avianknowledge.net/tdwg.
I think we still need to define occurrence, and I think that Arthur 
Chapman's "species occurrence data" gets us most of the way there. My sense 
is that the elaborations need to be expanded a bit more. For example, data 
collection event.  I suggest that we include in the definition some 
information about time, minimum required data, and so forth. These 
definitions can be longer and more detailed than the observation 
definition. So taking data collection event:  An event, during or after 
which at least the minimum required data were recorded.

Can we identify the minimum required data? For us it is:
who the collector is
where the information was collected (and should refer to occurrence 
information and all of the discussion with it)
when the data and time
what was observed (and how many)
effort distance covered, time spent etc.
I'm sure there are other data for the minimum required data and this is 
worth discussion.

We should also discuss the event. For example, one of ours and Bird Studies 
Canada projects (Project FeederWatch) the event can last 2 days.

We also need to think about whether we want to include protocol. In our 
definitions no protocol (incidental observation) is also a protocol.

Anyway, thanks for the improvements on the definition of observation. I 
(like Lynn) look forward to discussing some of these other issues.

Steve

I am in support of the suggested "group of organism", rather than "set".

I don't believe the second sentence means exactly the same thing. From a =
database point of vue, sometimes, a group of organism will be reported =
as one observation record, eg "10 Common Redpolls". The meaning of the =
second sentence is that observations are usually interlinked, eg, the =
"10 common redpolls and the 5 pine siskins where observed during the =
same 5 minute sampling period".

I'm also quite happy with the other definitions proposed so far.

Steve

Looking at the web site and thinking about definitions and terms - I am not entirely happy with the use of the term 'Negative data'.  In most of the areas I have been involved, the term 'Absence data' is more common and I think is more self explanatory (even though it is really implied absence rather than true absence in most cases).

Cheers

I am happy with something close to this.

I agree, however, I would like to include a measure of uncertainty.
Darwin Core has such an element, CoordinateUncertaintyInMeters, that would 
work. "The upper limit of the distance (in meters) from the given latitude 
and longitude describing a circle within which the whole of the described 
locality must lie. Use NULL where the uncertainty is unknown, cannot be 
estimated, or is not applicable."

Some revision along these lines would be helpful.

See my note above about the Darwin Core element 
CoordinateUncertaintyInMeters.

We don't need to be tied to a standard, but the closer we come to being 
consistent with the rest of the community, the more likely our standard is 
to be widely accepted.  In short, I like following the Darwin Core where 
it works for us, but I see no need to explicitly refer to the Darwin Core. 
Neither the Darwin Core or ABCD will work for us when it come to taxonomic 
identification and there we will need to use the TDWG TCS schema.

"Set of", or "group of", or "assemblage of" all work for me.

Seems we are on the same page, Robert

At the moment, I am preparing (for the BioGeomancer project) a document oin "Best Practices for Georeferencing" which will discuss in detail how to calculate Uncertainty.  At the moment, we are using a Point Radius Method (hence the Darwin Core element), but this is likely to move to footprinting in the future.  Also be aware, that the Geospatial Elements are being removed from Darwin Core 2, to be obtained via an Extension related to GML.  These will still include Uncertainty Elements.

Cheers

Dear Observations List Member,

As you may be aware the GUID-1 meeting has now taken place. The outcome 
of this meeting has wide ranging repercussions for all TDWG standards 
and their future interoperability. I am therefore calling a Technical 
Architecture Group meeting as soon as possible to discuss the best way 
to proceed. This meeting will be able to discuss issues, such as shared 
vocabularies, which are outside the scope of the GUID project.

You can read more about the proposed meeting here:

http://www.tdwg.hyam.net/twiki/bin/view/TAG/TagMeeting1

I would be grateful if you would consider whether you might attend or 
nominate some one to attend.

If you would like to discuss the meeting further please join the TAG 
list to save generating traffic on this list 
(http://www.tdwg.org/mailinglists.htm)

Best wishes,

Roger
(apologies if you have received this multiple times as it is going to 
several TDWG lists).

Hello,

We work in the field of agrobiodiversity, e.g. crop wild relatives. For us =
the combination of oberservation data and samples is very important.

We consider the unit as central element, which can be a part of an =
organism, an ogranism, or a group of organisms. The reason for going under =
the level of organism is that sometimes the plant with all roots etc. can =
be quite larger than the part that is observed and recorded for a certain =
location.

This describes the line we think along :
"A unit in our context is uniquely identified by time, place(site) and =
taxonomy. In addition a particular unit could be sampled to further assist =
in characterising it. Such samples could be (1) seed samples/planting =
material (classical ex situ accessions), (2) photos or (3) herbarium =
vouchers."

UNIT {time, site, taxonomy} (+ sample)

(With regard to the prior discussion I agree that we also have to handle =
legacy data with missing entries for time and place.)

Hello,
I really like the improvements made on the definition, and I might =
suggest=20
that I put it up on the TDWG-obs website http://www.avianknowledge.net/tdwg=
.
I think we still need to define occurrence, and I think that Arthur=20
Chapman's "species occurrence data" gets us most of the way there. My =
sense=20
is that the elaborations need to be expanded a bit more. For example, =
data=20
collection event.  I suggest that we include in the definition some=20
information about time, minimum required data, and so forth. These=20
definitions can be longer and more detailed than the observation=20
definition. So taking data collection event:  An event, during or after=20
which at least the minimum required data were recorded.

Can we identify the minimum required data? For us it is:
who the collector is
where the information was collected (and should refer to occurrence=20
information and all of the discussion with it)
when the data and time
what was observed (and how many)
effort distance covered, time spent etc.
I'm sure there are other data for the minimum required data and this is=20
worth discussion.

We should also discuss the event. For example, one of ours and Bird =
Studies=20
Canada projects (Project FeederWatch) the event can last 2 days.

We also need to think about whether we want to include protocol. In our=20
definitions no protocol (incidental observation) is also a protocol.

Anyway, thanks for the improvements on the definition of observation. I=20
(like Lynn) look forward to discussing some of these other issues.

Steve

Hi Sabine,

What you describe for plants is very much like what we often find in =
vertebrates.

At any given sampling event, you may want to characterise differently =
units that belong to the same taxon. In birds, if you are talking about =
banding (ringing) data, you typically want to record the characteristics =
of each individual (mass, body measurements, sex, band number, etc.). =
For that reason, a schema needs to allow repeating the same taxonomic =
unit multiple times in the same sampling event, each record with its own =
characteristics. On the other hand, if you have a group of organisms =
that all share exactly the same characteristics, it makes a lot more =
sense to have a field that tell you how many times this unit was =
repeated, rather than have separate records for each.

For all biodiversity monitoring, there are common fields that will allow =
you to describe what your unit is (taxonomic fields), in addition to =
other fields such date, time, location, etc. But each discipline will =
also have its own requirements. Bird banders typically do not care about =
soil or water pH, and you surely do not need to describe whether your =
units had a brood patch.

In a schema, the way to handle this is to put everything that is common =
to all disciplines in the core list of fields. DarwinCore already gives =
a number of those fields, but there are more common fields that can be =
added (DarwinCore was initially designed for museum specimens). =
Everything that is specific to a limited number of disciplines then need =
to be part of a schema extension. In birds monitoring, we think so far =
that this will represent about 4 or 5 different extensions (one for =
surveys, one for bird banding, one for nest records, etc.). The =
agrobiodiversity community will have to work on it's own extensions, as =
will other communities (which don't necessarily have to be taxon-based).

Cheers

Please note that the NatureServe species occurrence data is typically at
a coarser scale than observation or collection data:
=20
A Species Occurrence (SO) is an area of land and/or water in which a
species is, or was, present. A SO should have practical conservation
value for the species as evidenced by potential continued (or
historical) presence and/or regular recurrence at a given location. For
species Elements, the SO often corresponds with the local population,
but when appropriate may be a portion of a population (e.g., long
distance dispersers) or a group of nearby populations (e.g.,
metapopulation). A SO record has both spatial and tabular components
including a mappable feature and its supporting database attributes.

Subject: Public working draft of NatureServe Species Occurrence Schema,
comments invited



NatureServe is pleased to announce the release of a public working draft
(version 0.3) of an XML schema to describe species occurrence-level data
as reflected in NatureServe's biodiversity data model.  We are seeking
public review and comments on this version until March 3, 2006.
Comments received during the review period will be addressed in the next
release, version 1.0. =20

=20

NatureServe is evolving its data delivery strategy to use XML-based, Web
services protocols.  Last month the NatureServe Species Schema,
describing species profile-type information managed by NatureServe, and
familiar to many through our NatureServe Explorer website
(www.natureserve.org/explorer), was released for public review.  The
Species Occurrence Schema that is the subject of this announcement is
complementary to that schema, and focuses on describing spatially
explicit species locality data as managed by the NatureServe network.
The data represented by this schema provides a new level of spatial
precision not currently available on NatureServe Explorer.=20

=20

Our Web services strategy for sharing data among NatureServe network
members and with the broader community is dependent upon the usability
of these XML schemas.  For this reason, we are seeking as wide a review
as possible among our colleagues within the biodiversity informatics
community, and especially from those organizations that regularly rely
on and interact with NatureServe data. =20

=20

Reviewers are invited to submit comments on either the content or the
structure of the XML documents.  Content reviewers will want to follow
the link for the human-readable documentation.  We have also provided a
sample document for review, which contains example data in XML format
for one species occurrence record of Ardea herodias (Great Blue Heron).


=20

Reviewers should also note that this schema incorporates mapped
occurrence location information, represented as polygon shapes.  In
compliance with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for web map
and web feature services, the spatial elements of the species occurrence
schema are represented using Geography Markup Language (GML).  In
addition to the human readable documentation, technical reviewers will
find useful the links to the XSD documents.  Technical reviewer comments
may cover the names of the XML tags, the nesting of the XML document,
the structure of the XML schema, and the organization of the GML
components.  Technical reviewer comments from organizations that may
develop applications to consume NatureServe data as expressed by these
XML schema are highly encouraged.

=20

The NatureServe Species Occurrence Schema documentation can be found at:
http://services.natureserve.org/technical/speciesOccurrenceSchema.htm

=20

Please submit comments using the feedback forms found at the same
location, or via email to:

services@natureserve.org

=20

The complementary NatureServe Species Schema documentation can be found
at:

http://services.natureserve.org/technical/speciesSchema.htm=20

Reviewers may find it useful to compare the two documents.  While the
public comment period for the species schema has closed, we will
consider new comments as time permits within the schedule for releasing
the next version. =20

Denis, I agree with your sentiments here, and it is the only way we can handle the vast amount of differences. More than people expect, however, can be generalised for different groups. Allan Allison and myself had an intereting example of this in Indonesia many years ago where we were working with foresters, fisherman, insect people and botanists, and trying to look at the common denominator in as many fields as possible.  One that came up was collecting method where virtually every group saw their group as so specialised  and wanted fields that would only apply to them (fishermen for example for net type, size etc.)  We eventually got them all to see that we could use just "collecting method" with a different set of terms for each group.

But I think Sabine has an additional point that needs to be covered.

If I read Sabine rightly, she is talking about what the observation may be and not necessarily the aspects of that observation (measurements etc.). I think there are perhaps two aspects to what she is saying.

I can see the need for observation of "scat" or "hair" for mammals, "pupa" "lavae" for insects, "fruit" for plants, "nest" for a bird, etc. where these may have been observed separately from the main animal/plant etc.  It is an observation, but not an obseration of the whole animal/plant, etc.

I am not sure that 'Unit' is the best term, though - worth discussing.

Hi again,

I agree that Sabine's point is really pertinent, and I believe can be =
covered by a DarwinCore field called BasisOfObservation (or something =
along those lines).

The record can be use to describe an observation, a specimen, or a =
sample of some sort, which is linked to the presence of an organism. I =
believe that as long as you can put a taxonomic name to a sample, it can =
easily be described using the existing core structure, plus some =
discipline-specific descriptors. The taxonomic name doesn't have to down =
to the species level (can be family, order, etc.).=20

The main issue here will be to standardize how people are allowed to use =
the BasisOfObservation field (through controlled vocabulary), and to =
find ways to know whether you are reporting measurements (eg, mass) =
about the sample only or the full organism.

Where I think this will break down is when you'll try to describe =
non-living things (rocks, clouds, whatever). You probably still could to =
some extent, but that'd be a stretch of the primary purpose of a schema =
used for describing biodiversity monitoring.

Good weekend everyone
Denis

Hi,

I am splitting this out of the thread on observation definition as it is 
somewhat off that topic but I am quoting from something Denis said.

Denis said: "The main issue here will be to *standardize how people are allowed to use the BasisOfObservation field *(through controlled vocabulary), and to find ways to know whether you are reporting measurements (eg, mass) about the sample only or the full organism." (My emphasis)

I am interested in the notion of controlled vocabularies. We don't have them in normal text communication. Although I am picking words from a dictionary as I type I am free to make up my own words at any time. You may be able to understand their meaning from context or you may simply fail to understand what I am talking about. Words are normally added to dictionaries *after *they are in use not before.

If we invent controlled vocabularies for communication then we have to guess all the terms that anyone is likely to use ahead of time. A little like compiling a dictionary before we can use a language. This is:

    * Difficult - we have to have some person or group of people with
      100% knowledge of the domain.
    * Time Consuming - because people don't know everything they have to
      go away and learn and debate etc etc - possibly for years.
    * Error Prone - Once a list is settled on it will contain errors
      (everything does). People will also use the existing terms to mean
      something different from their official definition because they
      can't invent their own terms - the purpose of having the
      controlled vocabulary will be lost.
    * Unresponsive - once we have a list we have to stick with it till
      we update the whole thing.
    * Potentially difficult to manage - if the list is embedded in an
      XML Schema or imported into such a schema then changing it to add
      a new kind of animal trace for example will involve updating
      multiple schemas and possibly software etc etc.

I therefore suggest that it is far better to have 'recommended' 
vocabularies similar to Dublin Core where terms can be added and mixed 
with those from other vocabularies rather than 'hard-coded' vocabularies 
as occur in may XML Schema implementations.

People should be allowed to put what they like in BasisOfObservation 
field but should only expect to be understood if they use something from 
a common vocabulary. (The vocabulary has the chance to be self 
explaining if it uses URI/GUIDs - but that is another topic.)

I appreciate that this may be a sea change for some people in the way we 
think about transfer standards but believe it is the only way forwards 
if we want to handle the complexity of our data.

Thoughts and observations(!) much appreciated.

Roger

Roger

I couldn't agree with you more!

The first question that should always be asked is "why do I want a controlled vocabulary?"  Often the answer will be "so that I know what terms to use when I am searching"

A static vocabulary seldom works for long (other than in a small closed community), so you need an updateable vocabulary.  I think it is often better to use some form of linked  thesaurus etc. that can be added to, expanded, definitions modified if necessary.  This allows the user to get a definition, and look for possible synonymy in terms if they need to. I agree with your suggestion, Roger, of following a Dublin Core type process if necessary for different groups/classes of users if necessary.

There are several environmental thesauri around the world - some better than others - most overlapping in terms, etc.  Again off topic (but one of the things we need is a global, multilingual environmental thesaurus. There have been several attempts, some got close but then went their separate ways. There are standards available for preparing them .... but lets leave that for another discussion another day).

Lynn

I have only had a chance to have a quick look through your Schema, but at first glance it looks good.

One comment.  In your definitions of longitude and latitude you use them to refer to the "centrum of the Species Occurrence".  Is centrum the correct word here? Are you really refering to the Geometric Center, the Geographic Center or something else?  I have found very few references to its use in this context (why not use center if you want a fairly neutral term?)

Secondly in 'Calculated Representational Accuray' and 'Estimated Representational Accuracy'  you mention "(versus area added for locational uncertainty)" but I find no mention of locational uncertainty elswhere in the document.  I also query whether the term 'Accuracy' is correctly used here.  From the definitions, I don't see that they refer to Accuracy - but maybe I am reading your definitions wrongly. Perhaps you need to revisit the naming of these fields.

In "County Nation Code"  Do you mean "Country Nation Field"?  and in definition

New on-line survey <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=3D861321784377>
on how data custodians are overseeing the sharing of Sensitive Primary
Species Occurrence Data

The GBIF Secretariat <http://www.gbif.org/>  recognises concerns about
the unprotected distribution of Sensitive Primary Species Occurrence
Data (for example the exact localities of rare, endangered or
commercially valuable taxa). This as an important issue to be addressed
related to data to be shared through the GBIF network and made visible
through the GBIF Data Portal <http://www.gbif.net> .

We urgently need to review current approaches to obscuring or
generalizing such data, and to develop best practice recommendations in
this area.  It is also important to understand the possible impact that
such approaches may have on biodiversity science. This review will lead
to a discussion paper which will be made available later this year on
the GBIF web site.

The GBIF Secretariat wishes to examine:

* which data are regarded as 'sensitive'

* which approaches are currently used by GBIF data providers to protect
sensitive data (and the associated advantages and disadvantages of these
approaches)

* the extent to which each approach may be reversed through
co-relational analysis

* the extent that generalization may restrict various analyses

* the level of generalization that may be appropriate for different
types of data

* the best ways of documenting generalization of data and the methods
used

* whether a standard approach can be promoted for all sensitive data
provided through the GBIF network

* whether changes should be made to the TDWG ABCD and Darwin Core
schemas (used by GBIF for exchange of Primary Species Occurrence Data)
to facilitate sharing generalised data=20

We are offering an on-line survey
<http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=3D861321784377>

(http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=3D861321784377) and invite
representatives of all institutions holding Primary Species Occurrence
Data (specimen data, observations, living collections, and survey and
monitoring data) to fill out this survey. The deadline for completion is
April 1, 2006.

After this date the survey will be closed and we will compile the
responses to contribute to the review process.

Further background on the survey can be found in the introduction to the
survey <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=3D861321784377> . All
respondents will receive a link to the draft Discussion Paper when it
becomes available and there will be an opportunity to provide additional
comments and reflections before the report becomes public.

Hi all
I apologise for any cross postings, and Im not sure Ive even got the
right mailing lists here.
 
I am trying to get hold of a controlled vocabularly / list of terms
that define associations between organisms with respect to observations
or specimens.
For example parasites, hosts etc - eg to specify that a
specimen/observation was found living on another specimen (host).
 
I need this for the specimens RDF/LSID presentation I am giving at TDWG
this year.
 
Any help would be appreciated.
 
Thanks
Kevin Richards

Dear members of the TDWG mailing list tdwg-obs,

TDWG has seen a proliferation of mailing lists over the years, most of =
which
are inactive today. Traffic on most lists is rather little and usually
limited to only a short period of time. As most lists also have very =
much
the same subscribers, we are seeking to merge lists into just a few =
ones.
The main 3 mailing lists we want to maintain in the future being:

tdwg@lists.tdwg.org
A list with very low traffic for official TDWG  announcements from the =
executive committee
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg

tdwg-content@lists.tdwg.org
A list for all non technical discussions covering all TDWG working =
groups /
standards http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content

tdwg-tag@lists.tdwg.org
The technical architecture group list that will host discussions about =
the
technical details of standards
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-tag


Within the next days we will automatically add all subscribers of this =
list to tdwg and tdwg-content and will merge all existing archives of =
the mailing list tdwg-obs into tdwg-content. The list tdwg-obs will be =
closed and removed once the archives have been merged.


Best wishes,
Markus D=F6ring=
